(16, 25, 'L-1B Visa Permit- Requirements', '<p>The manager or executive being transferred to the US operations of an overseas business entity should meet the &quot;Specialized or expert knowledge&quot; Criteria. Such &quot;Specialized or expert knowledge&quot; may refer to a skill in the company&#39;s practices &amp; processes or may relate to following areas of the petitioning businesses Its creation, its services, its tools, practices and administration, or new interests, and its usage in global markets. Key factors which form basis a L-1B visa petition are:</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>It is required that the worker should have worked with the overseas (outside USA) offices of foreign business during the 3 years preceding to the admission to USA under the L-1B visa - for a nonstop duration of 1 year.</li>\r\n	<li>It is required that the sponsored manager or executive whose petition is being filed under L-1B intra-company transfer category is entering USA to offer specialized knowledge capability, to a branch or subsidiary of the principal overseas business, or any one of its qualifying groups.</li>\r\n	<li>It is required that that the L-1 Permit holder should aim to leave the shores of the US post the conclusion of his sanctioned stay. Only exception to this scenario is that the L-1B visas permit holder makes an application under an Employment based green card like EB-1 program and gets the visa.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<h3>Processing of L-1B application: Indicative concern areas</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>For all the awareness, that L-1 regime has generated over the years, the fact is that the fear related to the probability for conflicting adjudicatory standards at the different constituent posts and officers exists in reality and unambiguous standards would enable for more dependable adjudication. The problem is especially acute while deciding on L1-B visa applications for executives with &quot;specialized knowledge&quot; which is defined as follows:</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;An alien is considered to be serving in a capacity involving specialized knowledge with respect to a company if the alien has a special knowledge of the company product and its application in international markets or has an advanced level of knowledge of processes and procedures of the company.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In the backdrop of the virtual lack of statutory simplicity or interpretative direction, determinations as to specialized knowledge by requirement will over and over again depend on the consular officer proficiency in the context of the particular case&#39;s situations. Having said that there are issues, which are likely to be accepted as legitimate for making &quot;specialized knowledge&quot; determinations.</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>The &quot;proprietary nature of the knowledge&quot; - While it is not firmly needed that specialized knowledge involve knowledge of processes or methods proprietary to the petitioning firm, the possession of major proprietary knowledge can in itself fulfill the specialized knowledge prerequisite. Proprietary knowledge will fulfill the L condition when it &quot;would be difficult to impart to another without significant economic inconvenience&quot;.This knowledge may be gained via on-the-job training.</li>\r\n	<li>The specialized knowledge condition was planned for &quot;key&quot;&nbsp;workers. Even as it could be true in a small firm that all skilled workers are &quot;key&quot; for a bigger firm there ought to be a difference between &quot;key&quot; and regular workers. &quot;Key&quot;could also be indicated by the basis of the length of experience, level of knowledge, or level of dependability. An example is a situation where the individual has been made accountable for more difficult and/or sensitive ventures. In case a firm is claiming that all the workers working on technical subjects ought to be regarded to possess specialized knowledge, the firm, in all probability, is hiring a very low standard and hence such applications are best avoided. Conversely, there is no lawful ground to necessitate any particular restriction on the figure of workers that may be duly regarded key. But size of the company and its operations could form basis for a positive decision on multiple applications as &quot;key&quot; workers. In addition there could be a difference between those workers and regular trained employees.</li>\r\n	<li>The &quot;idea of more than ordinary&quot;&nbsp;is also central to L1 Specialized knowledge worker applications. The terms &quot;special&quot; and &quot;advanced&quot;&nbsp;denotes that the worker has more expertise or knowledge, vis-a-vis the common worker. The same does not necessitate an &quot;extraordinary&quot;&nbsp;level of expertise, just more than that of the everyday worker in the firm or the domain. The same may involve knowledge of special firm missions or more than usual experience and/or knowledge of software practices.</li>\r\n	<li>Job shops: Apart from the specialized knowledge conditions, the subject of job shops is crucial to the determination of ineligibility, and should be of noticeable concern.</li>\r\n	<li>Employer/worker association -&nbsp;L is a position for individuals being shifted to work inside a firm structure and not for a fresh company, and the subject of employer/worker relations has always been vital to the L adjudication. The legislation notes &quot;A migrant who will serve in a capacity involving specialized knowledge with respect to an employer for purposes of this title and will be stationed chiefly at the worksite of a sponsoring employer&quot;.</li>\r\n	<li>Petitioners other than the petitioning entity or its branch, subsidiary, or parent shall not be qualified for categorization under L visa in situations where the migrant will be managed and administered chiefly by any unaffiliated company or the placement of the migrant at the worksite of the unaffiliated recruiter is fundamentally an arrangement to give labor for lease for the unaffiliated business, rather than a placement in connection with the provision of a product or service for which specialized knowledge particular to the petitioning office is vital.</li>\r\n	<li>The indispensable component in deciding the existence of an &quot;employer-employee&quot; association is the right of management. Possession of the authority to engage or the authority to discharge is highly strong proof of the existence of an employer-employee association. It is critical to note that the source of the receiver&#39;s salary&nbsp;&amp; benefits while in the US (i.e., if he will be paid by the US or the overseas branch of the petitioning firm) is not controlling in deciding the eligibility for L position.</li>\r\n	<li>Apart from this, the employer-employee association includes a situation in which the recipient will not be paid directly by the petitioner, and such a recipient is not barred from proving eligibility for the L categorization.</li>\r\n	<li>A recipient who will be employed in the US directly by an overseas firm and who will not be managed in any manner by the overseas firm&amp;rsquo;s bureau in the US does not make the cut as an intra-firm transferee.</li>\r\n	<li>The subject of management by the sending overseas business entity is decisive. When the service is off-site, there may be two methods of deciding control: a) The worker may be directly managed by a supervisor from the sending firm; b) The worker could also work off-site minus direct management at that site, but in &quot;connection with the provision of a product or service for which specialized knowledge specific to the petitioning employer is necessary.&quot; The same may mean, for instance, that the worker would be working for an off-site, unaffiliated group that has no IT division, and so the worker would be employing specialized knowledge that only the petitioning organization may manage or weigh-up. The same may also mean the worker is working on a proprietary venture involving knowledge and skills particular to the petitioning recruiter and not owned by the unaffiliated organization. Conversely, an off-site worker working in the IT division of an unaffiliated firm who is not under the direct management of the petitioner, or working on a proprietary venture involving knowledge and skills particular to the petitioner would, perhaps, not be accepted for the L position on the basis of job shop concerns.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<ol>\r\n	<li>L-1A Visa to USA</li>\r\n	<li>USA L-1A Permit Requirements</li>\r\n	<li>Eligibility to File an L-1/A Visa</li>\r\n	<li>L-1B Visa Permit - Requirements</li>\r\n	<li>EB-1C Green Card</li>\r\n</ol>\r\n\r\n<p>Even if you seek more information about US L1b Visa you can write an email on info@orangeglobalconsultancy.in&nbsp;and one of the most experience immigration consultants will get in touch with you to help you out with your questions and concerns or you can also choose to call us on +91-8336933522.</p>', '', '715652903_org_img1.png', 'https://orangeglobalconsultancy.in/cms.php?type=MTY=', 1, '2023-12-19 03:06:48'),

(20, 122, 'Beware Investment Scams Take Advantage of US Immigrant Investor Scheme!', '<p>It has come to light that many fraudulent elements are exploiting the <strong>US Immigrant Investor Programme</strong>, also called EB-5 at the cost of hapless and gullible investors. Against this backdrop, the concerned organizations, namely, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission&#39;s Office of Investor Education and Advocacy and U.S. CITIZENSHIP AND IMMIGRATION Services (USCIS), have together come-up with an Investor Alert to warn individual investors about the INVESTMENT scams that make use of the programme.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Allegedly, on the radar of investment scams are overseas people who try to find the prized<strong> US Permanent Residency</strong>&nbsp;(PR) status, via the EB-5 Programme. The scheme proffers certain specific investors from abroad-who can prove that their investments are generating employment breaks in the nation-with a potential avenue to legally recognized PR in the nation.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Business owners submit an application to the USCIS to be chosen as &quot;regional centers&quot; for the scheme. These provide investment breaks in &quot;new commercial enterprises&quot; that may concern securities offerings. Via the EB-5, an investor from abroad-who makes an investment of a specific amount that is placed at risk, and generates or preserves a bare minimum number of employment opportunities in the nation-is qualified to present an application for conditional officially recognized PR in the US.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>On the way to the end of the two-year period of conditional residency, the overseas investor is qualified to submit a petition to have the conditions on their lawful PR done away with, in case he can show that the conditions for job creation have been fulfilled. But, overseas investors-who make an investment, via the EB-5-are not guaranteed a permit, or to become officially recognized permanent residents of the nation.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The truth that a business is selected as a regional center by the USCIS does not denote that the USCIS, the SEC, or for that matter, any other US organization has sanctioned the investments provided by the business, or has otherwise aired an opinion on the overall quality of the investment.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It is vital to research methodically any offering that claims to be associated with the EB-5.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Major Steps to Follow</h3>\r\n\r\n<p><em><strong>Verify if the USCIS has really the designated regional center</strong></em></p>\r\n\r\n<p>In case you wish to make an investment, via a regional center, certify the center is mentioned on the list of the present regional centers on the website of the USCIS. In case the list does not carry the name of the regional center, be alert. And, even if the same is on the list, it needs to be understood that the USCIS has not sanctioned the regional center or any of the investments the same provides.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><em><strong>Get hold of reproductions of papers given to USCIS</strong></em></p>\r\n\r\n<p>It is necessary that Regional centers present an initial petition (Form I-924) to get approval and designation of the USCIS, and present an information collection supplement (Form I-924A) towards the close of each calendar year. Look for copies of these forms and supporting papers given to the USCIS.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><em><strong>Demand investment details in black &amp; white</strong></em></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Request the issues for a reproduction of the investment offering memorandum or private placement memorandum. Thoroughly check it and research comparable projects in appraising the offer. Duly follow up with any questions that may strike you. In case you fail to comprehend the facts furnished in the document-or the issuer is not ready, or in a position to respond to your queries-desist from investing.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><em><strong>Check in case promoters are being given money</strong></em></p>\r\n\r\n<p>In case there are allegedly unaffiliated agents, consultants, attorneys, or agencies either advocating or sanctioning the investment, ask how much money or what kind of gains they look forward to obtain in connection with advising the investment.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><em><strong>Look for independent substantiation</strong></em></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Check if the claims made about the investment are really correct. In case the investment involves the building of commercial real estate, check county records to find-out if the issuer has really gained the right permits, and if state &amp; local property tax appraisals match with the values the regional center pins on the property. In case new firms have allegedly signed onto the mission, go straight to those firms for corroboration.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><em><strong>Scrutinize structural dangers</strong></em></p>\r\n\r\n<p>You need to comprehend that you could be making an investment in a fresh money-making venture with nil assets, and has been set up to loan funds to a firm that will utilize the funds to build up missions. Cautiously scrutinize loan papers &amp; offering statements to find-out whether the loan is secured by any collateral promised to investors.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><em><strong>Consider the developer&#39;s motivations</strong></em></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Over and over again, the EB-5 regional center principals and developers make what is called CAPITAL INVESTMENTS in the ventures they run. Be aware of the fact that in case principals and developers fail to make equity investment in the mission, their financial incentives may not be associated with its success.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Major Warning Signals</h3>\r\n\r\n<p><em><strong>Assurances of a permit or getting legitimate permanent residency rights</strong></em></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Despite the fact that investing, <strong>via EB-5</strong>, entitles you to submit an application for a conditional visa, there is no assurance whatsoever that the USCIS will give you a conditional permit, or later eliminate the conditions on your legally recognized permanent residency. The USCIS watchfully appraises each case even as it refuses cases where the rules for eligibility are not catered to. Assurances of either the receipt or specific timing of a permit or Green Card are clear warning indications of scam.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><em><strong>Definite investment returns or nil investment dangers</strong></em></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The funds invested, via the EB-5, ought to be at risk for the object of producing a return. In a situation where in you are assured investment returns, or informed that you will get back a section of the funds you duly invested, be distrustful.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><em><strong>Excessively steady soaring investment returns</strong></em></p>\r\n\r\n<p>It is a fact that investments are liable to fluctuate over time, mainly those that provide high returns. Be highly skeptical of an investment that claims to offer, or keeps on producing, high rates of return in spite of general market situations.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><em><strong>Unlisted investments</strong></em></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Despite the fact that a regional center may be chosen as a regional center by USCIS, it is a fact that majority of new money-making enterprise investment opportunities, provided via regional centers, are not listed either with the SEC, or for that matter, any state regulator. And when an offering is unlisted, it is just not achievable for the issuer to furnish investors with access to important details related to firm &amp; administration, goods, services, and finances that registration necessitates. In such situations, it is vital that investors get hold of extra facts/details related to the organization to aid make certain that the investment break is 100% genuine.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><em><strong>Unapproved sellers</strong></em></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Laws of federal and state securities necessitate investment experts and their firms which provide and dispose-off investments to be duly listed or registered. And description as a regional center does not fulfill the condition. Several fake investment plans involve unlicensed people or unregistered organizations.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><em><strong>Several organizations managed by the same people</strong></em></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Some specific EB-5 regional center INVESTMENTS are structured, via several layers of dissimilar firms that are run by the similar people. In such specific situations, corroborate that conflicts of interest have not only been completely revealed but also are reduced.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In case your investment, via EB-5 turns, proves to be in a fake securities offering, you may lose both-your money your pathway to the officially recognized permanent residency in the US. Cautiously vet any EB-5 offering, prior to making either an investment of your money or your expectation of gaining officially recognized permanent residency rights in the US.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Even if you seek more information about&nbsp;<strong>US Immigrant Investor Scheme&nbsp;</strong>&nbsp;can write an email on info@orangeglobalconsultancy.in&nbsp;and one of the most experienced immigration consultants will get in touch with you to help you out with your questions and concerns or you can also choose to call us on +91-8336933522.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>', '', '265999932_org_img1.png', 'https://orangeglobalconsultancy.in/cms.php?type=MjA=', 1, '2023-12-19 04:50:31'),

(22, 124, 'Understanding EB-1C Green Card Conditions For L-1A Visa Holders', '<p>L-1A visa holders can convert their status while being in USA and become a US green card holder by making an application under the EB-1C employment-based immigrant visa category for USA. The EB-1C stream requires that the receiver&rsquo;s status at qualifying foreign firm was managerial or executive.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Being and Continuing in Business</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>An critical condition for the L-1A &amp; the EB-1C is that the pleading group ought to be &quot;doing business&quot; as the term is described by Immigration US, for not less than 1 year overseas, and in America, prior to submitting a petition. Through the L-1A, &quot;New Office&quot; it is expected that the:</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>The American firm has obtained enough physical grounds to carryout business;</li>\r\n	<li>Recipient fulfills the 1-year nonstop employment abroad condition; and</li>\r\n	<li>The freshly formed US firm will, inside 1 year or 12 months, &quot;support an executive or managerial position.&quot;</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p>Sanction for the New Office L-1 submission will merely be for 1 year. Towards the close of the 1st year, the firm will require submitting an extension proving that the firm is active, completely ready, and needs either an executive or a manager.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This characteristically involves proving that the US entity has developed its American incomes, and it has employed extra workers. The 1st year for the L-1A holders &quot;New Office&quot; happens to be a temporary time, post which the firm has to establish it is rather committed to being in industry in the country. Post the said extension is sanctioned, only after that the receiver can chase the EB-1C Green Card.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Apart from the condition that the group is in existence in America for a period of 1 year, it is crucial that the applicant also proves that the firm abroad will keep on operating; even post the recipient has been moved to the US bureau. It&#39;s true in the situations of the EB-1C &amp; the L-1 Permit, and is particularly spot on in a situation where in the transferee is a chief factor behind the foreign firm&#39;s success.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Via the L-1 permit stream - in case a firm stops to function in the overseas nation - the L-1 permit standing is annulled, and the recipient should change his position in the US to a new categorization, or leave the country.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Through the EB-1C class, the stoppage of the business activities by the overseas firm, prior to the beneficiary gains their Green Card, would result in the US immigration body, i.e., the USCIS, cancelling the principal I-140, and also refusing the petition filed for Permanent Residence. For these grounds, the continuing running of the overseas and the US bureaus is a constant provision for the L-1 &amp; the EB-1C streams.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Summing-up, making the cut and being accepted for the EB-1C, Multinational Executives and Managers immigrant permit class is beneficial since there is not any requirement of any labor certification for the receiver. Labor certification is a dreary procedure and this involves many extra steps. The firm has to carryout test of the labor market; via a recruitment process to come to a decision in case any modestly qualified US employees are obtainable who are prepared, talented, and ready to occupy the post.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>As most of the times, the opening would be for a higher-ranking executive or manager; such staffing would neither help or be sincerely embarked on by the firm. The EB-1C stream is molded for the specific situation, permitting the international groups to move higher-ranking executives and managers to the US with just an employment offer, and minus a requirement for the staffing.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But, making the cut for the <strong>EB-1C</strong> <strong>immigrant permi</strong>t is not an easy job. As delineated in the edit, getting hold of a prior L-1A support shows that the recipient will possibly also make the grade for an EB-1C, as the qualifications as the two permit streams are incredibly comparable.

They are described as follows:</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Express Entry Program&nbsp;- Launched in 2015, Express Entry is an online application management system that governs all federal streams under economic migration programs, which includes Federal Skilled Worker, Canadian Experience Class, and Federal Skilled Trades. Under this system, people who wish to live and work in Canada, and who meet the minimum eligibility requirements may submit an expression of interest in applying for permanent residence by creating an online profile.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Every profile under the Express Entry is given a Comprehensive Ranking System (CRS) score that is further used to rank applicants against each other in the pool. The higher the scores, the better are the chances for receiving an Invitation to Apply from Immigration, Refugees, and Citizenship Canada (IRCC).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Canada Provincial Nominee Programs -The Canadian government has given its provinces rights in selecting economic immigrants and inviting them to permanently settle in Canada. Every province in Canada has its own levels of guidelines and selection criteria to pick candidates to address labor shortage needs of that particular province. All these provincial immigration streams are popularly known as Provincial Nominee Programs (PNPs).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Quebec Skilled Worker Program -&nbsp;As compared to any other Canadian province, Quebec enjoys a high degree of authority to set its own rules for immigration. Presently, no Quebec immigration stream is aligned with Express Entry. However, candidates may choose to apply directly for the Quebec Skilled Worker Program, the Quebec Experience Class, and Quebec Business Immigration.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Student Pathway&nbsp;- Student pathway is a definitive choice for any one who is not eligible for any of the immigration streams mentioned above. Interested candidates may choose to study in Canada as the credentials they gain while studying here can instantly improve their chances for obtaining Canada PR visa. Since many immigration programs give preference to Canadian student experience, studying in Canada can be an ideal way to get a Canadian permanent resident status.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Start-up Visa&nbsp;- This visa category is suitable for high net-worth entrepreneurs who want to set up a new business in Canada. For this, they must get their business or business idea sponsored by an authorized body in Canada and thus migrate to the country permanently.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Family Sponsorship&nbsp;- Family reunification is the second most popular way of migrating to Canada permanently. If you are married to person or have a child who is a Canadian citizen, they can sponsor you to come to Canada. The only condition is that the sponsor must be financially strong enough to support you in Canada.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Canada PR Point Requirements from India 2023</p>\r\n\r\n<p>To get an invitation to apply from Canada, one needs to score at least 67 points out of 100 based on various factors, such as age, work experience, language skills, etc. In every two-weeks, CIC conducts immigration draws to announce minimum CRS cut-off for candidates who are eligible under the Canada immigration.

Frankly speaking, it is really <strong>Canada Immigration</strong>&nbsp;which motivates these people the most; in fact, like any and everything. A remarkable figure of the migrants to the country want to gain the nation&#39;s prized and much sought after Permanent Residency (PR) status, and become its Permanent Residents, for understandable reasons. It is commonly said that Canada is world&#39;s number one immigration destination.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>What Actually Canada Permanent Resident Is?</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Canada Permanent Resident or Canada PR is essentially a person, who does not have the country&#39;s citizenship, but has been provided with the permission to simple reside, and/or do a job or business or invest inside the nation&#39;s territories, minus any kind of restrictions at all on time-period put on his stay in Canada on Permanent Resident Visa. Any employer can employ you and a&nbsp;<strong>Canada PR</strong>&nbsp;<strong>Visa&nbsp;</strong>cardholder does not need a work permit to take up a job in Canada. Likewise, businessmen can do any business or invest in any area or part of Canada by just meeting the regulatory requirements for doing such investment or starting or running such a business. There are specific Canada immigration program for skilled professionals and Businessmen &amp; Investors.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Despite the fact that the nation&#39;s permanent residents carry on being their home country&#39;s citizens, they also enjoy certain rights &amp; privileges in Canada as well. Practically, they can enjoy all the rights of a citizen except for right to vote in elections and Canadian passport. It is another matter that in order to maintain their position as a PR, they have to satisfy certain mentioned duties involving residency. For instance, it is necessary that they reside inside the Maple Country, for at least two years out of every five years to maintain their cherished permanent standing. New regulations are in the pipeline whereby a Permanent Residence card (PR CARD) holder of Canada would be required to stay in Canada for at least 4 out of 6 years to retain residency and in addition may be required to stay for 6 months out of every 12 month period. Keep visiting this website on regular basis to get updated&nbsp;<strong> immigration news</strong>&nbsp;or simply subscribe to our newsletter to know as and when this proposal become law!</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Significantly, every permanent resident is given what is known as the Permanent Resident Card (PR Card); it&#39;s the certified proof of his unique position as a permanent resident of the nation. He has to produce it whenever the involved officials ask him for it. PR card permits a person to travel outside of Canada and re-enter country. Those entering the country on a short-term basis like an international student and/or a temporary overseas worker lacks Canada&#39;s PR rights and is not a permanent resident.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Canada Permanent Resident Vs Canada Citizens</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Some people over and over again fail to differentiate between a Canada Permanent Resident and a Canada Citizen even as they think the rights and obligations of these two are quite parallel. Yes, it&#39;s a fact that there is hardly any remarkable dissimilarity between the rights and responsibilities of a Canadian permanent resident and a Canadian citizen. Both possess the same right to get professionally associated with any company, apart from the federal or provincial administration (some checks do exist). In addition, the permanent residents much like the citizens have the right to join the nation&#39;s defence forces.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Still, the&nbsp;<strong>Canada permanent residents</strong>&nbsp;do not have several rights, as compared to the citizens of the nation. For example, they do not have the right to vote; they cannot contest for any kind of elected office; and much more importantly, possess the nation&#39;s passports. Apart from this, unlike the citizens, the permanent residents could be deported from the country for grave crimes committed inside the nation&#39;s territories. Last but not the least, although it is fact that the permanent residents have a right to submit a submission for citizenship, post 3 years inside Canada; it is not binding.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Even if you seek more information about&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>Canada Permanent Resident&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong>you can write an email on info@orangeglobalconsultancy.in and one of the most experienced immigration consultants will get in touch with you to help you out with your questions and concerns or you can also choose to call us on +91-8336933522.</p>', '', '735195688_org_img1.png', 'https://orangeglobalconsultancy.in/cms.php?type=MzA=', 1, '2023-12-20 04:52:30'),

Secondly, they must have a minimum of 1 year of experience and a minimum bachelor&#39;s degree or diploma. Then, the applicant must be proficient in the English language by scoring a minimum CLB 7 in the approved language test examinations.

Primarily, you can retake the IELTS examination. If you score better bands, then you can score a high CRS score within the due process. Alternatively, you can apply for the PNP program, which does not require a job offer with minimal requirements. And, you may change your primary applicant or get a job offer from a Canadian employer, which boosts your CRS score. Or, you can pursue further education in Canada, which assures extra points with Canadian education and experience which can be attained in due course.</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li><strong>If my CRS score ranges between 300 to 400, what choice do I have for Canada PR?</strong></li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p>If your CRS score ranges from 300 to 400, then practically, your chances of getting Canada Immigration are slim.

According to the trends, once the restrictions are lifted, the selection points under <strong>Canada Points Calculator&nbsp;</strong>can further decline to 460 but not beyond 400.

If your occupation is in demand with these provinces, then you can easily gain provincial nominations. You can choose other PNPs as well according to their requirements.</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li><strong>What is the difference between Canada Express Entry and Canada PNP?</strong></li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>â€‹â€‹â€‹â€‹â€‹â€‹â€‹</strong>Canada Express Entry is the federal program that provides a direct Canada PR Visa upon selection.

Upon selection, you will get ITA which assures the PR visa.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Whereas PNP is the alternative immigration pathways run by provinces of Canada. Each PNP program has different eligibility requirements for the applicants. Upon selection, the applicants will get the nomination and additional CRS points of 600. Once you receive the nomination, it will enable you to receive ITA and PR eventually.</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li><strong>How do I calculate points for Canada Express Entry?</strong></li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>â€‹â€‹â€‹â€‹â€‹â€‹â€‹</strong>It is essential to meet the <strong>Canada PR requirement</strong>&nbsp;to proceed with the application. And, for calculating the points, you need to assess the factors such as Age, Education, Experience, Language, and Adaptability. For ages 20 to 29 years, you can secure the maximum points. You can score as high as 136 points under language proficiency if you score high bands in the language exams. Higher education can fetch you 120 to 150 points, and higher experience will get you a maximum of 50 points.

The CRS assessed the applicants on the basis of certain pre-determined criteria, like:</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>Age,</li>\r\n	<li>Linguistic skills,</li>\r\n	<li>Academic accomplishments,</li>\r\n	<li>Professional exposure, and</li>\r\n	<li>Other deemed vital profile traits that can evidence ability of new entrants in settling in the Canadian environment;</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p>After gauging the profiles, the <strong>Comprehensive Ranking System&nbsp;</strong>(CRS) ranks them on the basis of the marks obtained;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>6. How to attain Additional Points</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Additional marks can be obtained by the candidates under following conditions:</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>Sponsorships earned from a wiling Canadian state, if any; or</li>\r\n	<li>Full time regular employment offer from a Canadian employer;</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>7. The Selection Procedure</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The CIC conducts short listing draws at regular intervals to pick the applicants who have scored highest marks; or have a provincial nomination to their credit; or have obtained a permanent employment offer from a Canadian employer through job bank;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>8. The final stage of the Application</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The shortlisted candidates are instructed to go ahead with filing of second sets of applications for <strong>Canada permanent resident</strong>. Selected candidates are given 60 days to respond, failing which the invitation is cancelled; and</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The CIC promises to evaluate requests of the selected applicants within six months of receipt of completed requests;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Our past experience and current engagement with the Canadian Skilled Immigration System gives us every reason to firmly believe and suggest that the current format of Canadian skilled migration system holds several promises; as selected candidates can get Canadian Immigration Visa faster than any other comparable scheme. You just need to do the things right the very first time, i.e. compile all the requisite documents and negotiate all the required steps meticulously.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>How Long Is The Express Entry Process?</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Express Entry process can take as short as six months, from the submission of an Express Entry profile to the issuance of a permanent residence visa. However, not all cases will proceed at this rate. If you do not receive an invitation to apply, your Express Entry profile will remain active in the pool of candidates for 12 months. If you have not gotten an invitation after 12 months, you may resubmit your profile and remain in the pool. To elaborate, consider the following:</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>Your profile will be valid in the Express Entry pool for 12 months</li>\r\n	<li>You will have 60 days from the issue of the ITA to submit the requisite full application of papers.</li>\r\n	<li>IRCC may process your application for a permanent residence visa in approximately six months after the immigration authorities have received your entire application.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>How Can I Improve My CRS Score?</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Your CRS score can be improved by paying attention to the following points:</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Take the IELTS Again</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Improving your IELTS score is the most effective approach to gain points. Good IELTS grades might earn you up to 160 points on their own.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>However, if you have an excellent IELTS score and post-secondary education, you can gain an extra 50 points. If you have worked for at least three years and have a good IELTS score, you can get an extra 50 points.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>To be eligible for Express Entry under the<strong> Federal Skilled Worker program</strong>, you must have a Canadian Language Benchmark (CLB) 7 score, equivalent to a&nbsp;minimum IELTS score&nbsp; of 6.0 on each language ability. However, if you achieve CLB 9 in all language abilities, you could be eligible for up to 260 Express Entry points simply for your language ability.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>You may take the IELTS as many times as you choose. After submitting your profile to the pool, you can even update your Express Entry profile with new IELTS test results.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Immigration Tip:</strong>&nbsp;Register immediately for the&nbsp; <strong>IELTS exam</strong>. If you don&#39;t perform as well as you hoped, you&#39;ll have a chance to repeat the tests before submitting your profile. You can always edit your profile, but if you wait until you&#39;re already in the pool to increase your score, you may miss out on draws.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Work Experience</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Since Express Entry administers applications for economic immigration streams, your employment history plays a significant role in determining your Express Entry points.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>However, gaining additional years of work experience solely to increase your Express Entry points is difficult.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>If you are not eligible for Express Entry, or if you are eligible but do not have a competitive score, consider first coming to Canada as a student or temporary worker. Canadian experience might lead to a plethora of further Canadian immigration options.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>However, many candidates do not make the most of the professional experience they do have. Express Entry assigns points to all occupations using the<strong>&nbsp;National Occupational Classification</strong>&nbsp;(NOC) matrix. One of the most simple ways to improve your score is to pick the right NOC code.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>If you obtain an invitation to apply for permanent residency, you will be required to confirm that the NOC codes you state in your work experience are correct, so do not falsify your experience.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>However, it is worthwhile to take the time to determine which NOC codes accurately represent your professional expertise and give you the most Express Entry points.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The NOC matrix can be difficult to navigate, therefore consulting an expert to determine which NOC codes you can claim can be extremely beneficial.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Spousal Points</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>It may not apply to all candidates, but if you have a spouse or common-law partner, you may be losing some points.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>There are three alternatives here, and it&#39;s worth investigating all of them.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>First and foremost, your spouse or partner may get you additional points. Your spouse or partner may be able to enhance your&nbsp;<strong>Express Entry points</strong>&nbsp;by retaking a language exam or obtaining an educational credential assessment (ECA) for any post-secondary degree they have.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Second, as a single applicant, you may really have a higher score. Because your score is affected by whether or not you have an accompanying spouse or partner, you could improve your score by describing them as non-accompanying. If you are granted permanent residence, you can still sponsor them to come to Canada, but there will be a period of separation.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Third, your spouse may be a better candidate than you. You should definitely go through the practice of calculating how many points your spouse would receive if they were the primary applicant, with or without you.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>If you and your husband or partner are both strong candidates, you can submit separate profiles to the Express Entry pool and identify each other as accompanying. You quadruple your chances of success this way!</p>\r\n\r\n<p>If you&#39;ve done well on language tests, claimed as many points as possible for your work experience, and maximized your spousal points and still don&#39;t have a competitive score, there are several more difficult ways to enhance it.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Job Offer</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>An eligible job offer from a Canadian business can earn you 50 to 200 bonus points. Spend time on the Canada Job Bank, private job boards, and social networking sites to interact with Canadian companies in your field.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Provincial Nomination</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>If you are nominated by a province, you will receive 600 bonus points. Many provinces have nomination programs that are similar to Express Entry, however it is normally up to the individual to determine which programs they may be eligible for and how to apply. Remember that applying for a provincial nomination is typically a distinct application process.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Study</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Going back to school is a significant expenditure, but it may have a significant impact. A one-year post-secondary certificate program, for example, may get you a lot of points. If you already hold one three-year or more post-secondary degree for 120 points and enroll in a second one-year program, you can claim an additional 8 points for merely education. If you already have CLB 9, as well as two years of Canadian work experience, you can get an extra 50 points for skills transferability. That&#39;s a total of 58 new Express Entry points.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Canadian educational qualifications are highly valued in Express Entry, and being a foreign student can open many more possibilities to permanent residency in Canada that you might not be qualified for otherwise.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>', '', '972563336_org_img1.png', 'https://orangeglobalconsultancy.in/cms.php?type=NDE=', 1, '2023-12-21 03:32:08'),

(45, 165, 'Canada Express Entry - Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs)', '<div>\r\n<p>On January 1, 2015, the Citizenship and Immigration Canada (CIC) officially introduced an electronic arrangement, on the lines of a similar system already in operation in Australia, called Skill Select. The Canadian electronic system is known as Express Entry, even as it has been started to administer the petitions submitted for the prized and the much sought after Permanent Residence (PR), through these federal economic immigration schemes, namely, the Federal Skilled Worker Program (FSWP), the Federal Skilled Trades Program (FSTP), and the Canadian Experience Class (CEC). Understanding key Features of <strong>Express Entry Programm</strong>&nbsp;will help the candidates and this FAQ is a step in that direction.<br />\r\nIt is hoped that this FAQ will help the Express Entry candidates and they would be able to make the most of the scheme without being troubled by any doubts and uncertainties.&nbsp;<br />\r\n<br />\r\n<strong>Question: What exactly is Canada Express Entry program (EEP) and how it functions?</strong><br />\r\n<strong>Answer:</strong> EEP directs and supervises the permanent residence petitions presented in these current economic immigration schemes of Canada the Federal Skilled Worker Program (FSWP), the Federal Skilled Trades Program (FSTP), and the Canadian Experience Class (CEC). In additional to skilled immigrants chosen by the federal government, various Canadian provinces &amp; territories are also enabled to enlist applicants from the Express Entry pool for a segment of the Provincial Nominee Programs (PNPs), with a view to fulfill the particular requirements of their local labor market.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nVia the system, individuals, who cater to the conditions for any of the above given schemes, are put into a bank of aspirants called Express Entry Pool even as the Canadian administration, the various provincial &amp; territorial administrations, and Canadian recruiters/firms are enabled to choose individuals from the given pool.<br />\r\nExpress Entry together with the Job Bank of the Canadian Administration&nbsp;lets qualified recruiters/firms in the Maple Leaf Country and qualified nationals from abroad develop links with one another in a better manner, in the process, making integration swifter after aliens land in the nation. And, Invitation to Apply (ITA) is given to the aspirants meeting the points cut-off announced under the CRS ranking, from time to time.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n<strong>Question: How is the program proving helpful for Canada?</strong><br />\r\n<strong>Answer: </strong>Through the <strong>Express Entry</strong>, the CIC only entertains petitions from those it sends the invites, to immigrate to Canada, via certain particular economic immigration schemes. It discourages the growth of application inventory build-ups, by making certain that only the applicants who are most expected to do well and not just the first to present their petitions are in a position to put forward an application to move to the nation.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n<strong>Question: Which specific immigration schemes are parts of the Express Entry structure?</strong><br />\r\n<strong>Answer: </strong>The program is applicable to these economic immigration plans <strong>Federal Skilled Worker Program (FSWP)</strong>, Federal Skilled Trades Program (FSTP), and Canadian Experience Class (CEC). The various Canadian provinces &amp; territories are now in a position to employ aspirants from the Express Entry system, for a part of the PNPs, with a view to fulfill the requirements of the local labor market.<br />\r\n&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Question: Does the EEP change or amend the scheme&rsquo;s immigration conditions?</strong><br />\r\n<strong>Answer: </strong>Express Entry is just a method for the CIC to administer and run the submission of the economic immigration petitions made online. The Federal points selection Criteria whereby minimum 67 points out of a maximum of 100 points is required continues to be applicable.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n<strong>Question: Is it mandatory to have a confirmed work offer to find a position in the Express Entry bank?<br />\r\nAnswer: </strong>No. The key competition for selection from pool is to be amongst candidates <em>without confirmed job offer</em>, based on their rank in the CRS. Priority should be to get into the EE pool, submitting profile into the Canada Job Databank and let the opportunities unfold; that now is the way forward to immigration to Canada. Only those who are in the pool can have an opportunity of taking advantage of sudden drop in cut-off points under CRS ranking or being noticed by an employer or for that matter presence in the pool is even a priority for filing an application under the provincial nomination program. So if one is interested in migrating to Canada, then to be in the express entry pool is the first and unavoidable step.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n<strong>Question: Is there an upper limit on the number of applicants given entry to the pool of Express Entry?</strong><br />\r\n<strong>Answer: </strong>No, there is no cap whatsoever on the number of aspirants who could file their applications into the pool of Express Entry. And this leads to a range of applicants with a superior mixture of expertise &amp; experience from which the many Canadian recruiters, territories &amp; provinces can choose to fulfill their particular requirements. However, there is as annual quota CAP on number of federal skilled permanent resident visas for skilled workers and professionals that are issued every year. Hence sooner, one gets into the express entry pool and submits the profile into Canada Job Data bank, more are the chances for them to be accepted under the Canada express Entry Program.<br />\r\n&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Question: Job Bank - How does it function with Express Entry?</strong><br />\r\n<strong>Answer: </strong>Canada job Data Bank offers an opportunity to<strong> </strong>recruiters in Canada and foreign based skilled, to develop links with one another in a superior manner. After the application is successfully submitted in the express entry pool, a personal reference number is issued. The candidate should lodge personal resume in the <strong>Canada Job Bank</strong>&nbsp;making mention of this personal reference number. That opens up the profile for review of Canadian Employers, federal agencies and provincial government&rsquo;s.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n<strong>Question: How does the Express Entry process works?</strong><br />\r\n<strong>Answer: </strong>To begin with, the candidate shows the interest in moving to the nation, via generating an online profile for Express Entry. Under the <strong>Comprehensive Ranking System</strong>&nbsp;(CRS), candidate shares information associated with work experience, language skills, education, and other particulars that may play a key role in his success in the Maple Leaf Country with the CIC. And, in case the candidate makes the cut-off in the draws, an invitation to apply (ITA) is issued to him.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n<strong>Question: How does Express Entry prove useful for the possible applicants?</strong><br />\r\n<strong>Answer: </strong>The program provides several benefits, and this comprises swifter processing times: Majority of the petitions that receive ITA will be fittingly processed in a maximum of 6-12 months, from the time the CIC obtains an all-inclusive petition submitted for permanent residence to a decisive, final decision; and it opens up possibilities of obtaining an employment offer from an qualified recruiter in the Maple Leaf Country prior to landing in Canada or receiving nomination from a province.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n<strong>Question: Is there a charge to present a profile for Express Entry?</strong><br />\r\n<strong>Answer: </strong>There is no such charge whatsoever to put forward a profile for Express Entry. However, to be able to file the application in the pool, the candidate must provide key information related to educational credentials, IELTS tests etc. In case of married applicants such expenses must be incurred for both the spouses, especially if the application is being filed with an accompanying spouse. In addition, once the candidate is chosen from the pool and invited to apply for Permanent Residence Visa, he is required to pay required application fee, RRPF, medical costs and any other related incidental expenses.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n<strong>Question: For how long does the profile of an applicant, filed in the express entry pool remain?</strong><br />\r\n<strong>Answer: </strong>A profile for Express Entry stays valid for 12 months, from the date an applicant successfully submission in the pool and in case the candidate fails to receive an Invitation to Apply (ITA) within this period and is still wishes to arrive in Canada as a skilled immigrant, then he is required to file a fresh profile into the pool.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n<strong>Question: How do various Canadian territories &amp; provinces make use of the Express Entry structure?<br />\r\nAnswer: </strong>They are in a position to offer nomination to a certain number of overseas people, via the Express Entry structure, to cater to their particular local labor market immigration &amp; requirements. In case a candidate receives a nomination from a specific Canadian territory or province, he will get adequate extra points to get an invite, to submit a petition for the permanent residence status at the coming skilled draw of applicants.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n<strong>Question: What is the procedure for the probable applicants who wish to utilize both Express Entry &amp; a Provincial Nominee Program (PNP)?</strong><br />\r\n<strong>Answer: </strong>The applicant must successfully submit the Express Entry profile. The many territories &amp; provinces can afterwards explore the Express Entry bank and ask an aspirant to submit an application for their <strong>PNP Canada</strong>, and when the latter obtains a certificate for nomination, they will duly bring up to date their profile for Express Entry. This will surely mean that the candidate will move up in the ranking in the CRS, because he will get 600 additional points and almost certain selection for an ITA in subsequent draws from the pool.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n<strong>Question: How is the scheme will prove useful for recruiters/firms in the Maple Leaf Country?</strong><br />\r\n<strong>Answer: </strong>It offers them more recruitment choices and assists them to act in response to labor scarcities in a superior way where permanent residents or citizens are not accessible.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n<strong>Question: How does recruiter/firms in the Maple Leaf Country utilize the Express Entry?</strong><br />\r\n<strong>Answer: </strong>It is vital that the recruiter/firms in the nation first make every possible attempt to discover either a permanent resident or a citizen to fill unoccupied work-opportunities. Qualified recruiter/firms who are unable to find a Canadian or permanent resident, for a permanent job are encouraged to think about aspirants from the Job bank who cater to their particular requirements. Express Entry &amp; Job Bank permits qualified Recruiters/firms in the nation and entitled trained nationals from abroad to develop links with one another without any problems.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n<strong>Question: Can a recruiter who presently hires a temporary foreign worker (TFW) make use of Express Entry to shore-up his petition for the permanent residence status?</strong><br />\r\n<strong>Answer: </strong>Yes! As long as the TFW is in Canada working, under a positive Labor Market Impact Assessment (LMIA), the recruiter can provide him with a permanent job, to prop-up his petition for permanent residence. It is essential that the TFW generates an Express Entry profile and incorporates his work offer particulars. An employment offer duly backed by an LMIA will offer a candidate with adequate extra points and be positioned high enough to be sent an invite to put forward an application, at the coming eligible draw of aspirants.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n<strong>Question: Does the danger of fraud from candidates or recruiters exist?</strong><br />\r\n<strong>Answer: </strong>As already stated, the Administration of Canada has a zero tolerance for such cases even while it takes the scheme reliability incredibly seriously. The CIC expects the aspirants to be honest in their Application for Permanent Residence and for self-stated profile for Express Entry. At some point in processing, an immigration official will appraise &amp; authenticate all information. Those who have furnished false details may be found inadmissible for distortion of facts, and might be prevented for a period of 5 years from submitting an application for permanent resident position.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n<strong>Question: Is it possible for an Express Entry applicant to arrive in Canada and begin working prior to he obtains his PR Permit? </strong><br />\r\n<strong>Answer: </strong>No, the applicants for Express Entry cannot typically arrive in the nation, for job purposes, until and unless he is armed with his permanent resident permit.

(68, 177, 'How to Apply for the C11 Visa Canada in 2023', '<h2><strong>C11 Visa Canada Work Permit for Entrepreneurs &amp; Self-Employed</strong></h2>\r\n\r\n<p>There are more than 100 immigration pathways for Canada, but C11 visa Canada stands out among those routes. The pathway is an LMIA-Exempt work permit carved for entrepreneurs and self-employed individuals who have the potential to provide significant social, economic, and cultural benefits to Canadians. Under the work permit, entrepreneurs and self-employed professionals can enter Canada temporarily and establish their businesses or self-employed ventures.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Canada has introduced the International Mobility Program (IMP) that empowers Canadian employers to recruit temporary workers from all corners of the world. The attractive feature of this pathway, where Labor Market Impact Assessment (LMIA) rules, does not apply to immigrants&#39; work permit requests. And, International Mobility Program (IMP) has another LMIA exemption route which goes by name of C11 Work Permit Canada.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2><strong>What are the points to remember before applying for C11 Visa Canada?</strong></h2>\r\n\r\n<p>If you are aiming to get a temporary stay or permanent residency under the C11 visa Canada, you need to declare to the visa immigration officer that:</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>You are the owner of a business or are a self-employed individual who possesses a viable and unique business plan and resources</li>\r\n	<li>Your business or self-employment concept can bring substantial social, economic, and cultural benefits for Canadian citizens</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<h2><strong>What are the eligibility requirements of the C11 Work Permit?</strong></h2>\r\n\r\n<p>To be eligible, applicants must meet the c11 visa Canada requirements outlined by the program guidelines. Owning a business in your home country alone does not guarantee you approval as several other factors are taken into consideration.</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>Must have the history and experience to set up a successful venture, or they have the resources to purchase an existing Canadian business</li>\r\n	<li>Have a minimum of 50% of the ownership of the business they establish or buy in Canada.</li>\r\n	<li>Must have a detailed business plan for the business in Canada</li>\r\n	<li>Must create opportunities and benefits for Canada and Canadians in various fields</li>\r\n	<li>Must have done enough preparation and groundwork to establish their business/work in Canada and to meet the c11 visa Canada eligibility</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<h2><strong>What are the eligible businesses under the C11 Entrepreneur Work Permit?</strong></h2>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>Lawn care and landscaping</li>\r\n	<li>Moving services</li>\r\n	<li>Chimney sweeping service</li>\r\n	<li>Outdoor Adventure Company</li>\r\n	<li>Pool maintenance services</li>\r\n	<li>Personal trainer or coach</li>\r\n	<li>Christmas/Halloween retailer</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<h2><strong>What Does &quot;Significant Benefit&quot; to Canada Mean?</strong></h2>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;Significant benefit to Canada&quot; under c11 work permit Canada generally means that the applicant must have a solid plan to create an economic stimulus for Canadians and permanent residents. It means creating new jobs, growth of Canadian exports, industry advancement, or development work in any particular region.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2><strong>How does C11 work permit Canada lead to permanent residency?</strong></h2>\r\n\r\n<p>It is important to note that the<strong> </strong>c11 visa Canada process works very differently as compared with other pathways. The program does not directly lead you to Canadian Permanent Residency. However, you can achieve <strong>Canada PR Visa</strong>&nbsp;in the two-step process:</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li><strong>First &ndash; </strong>Manage your business of <strong>self-employement in Canada&nbsp;</strong>for a minimum of 12 consecutive months under a valid work permit</li>\r\n	<li><strong>Second &ndash; Meet the Federal Skilled Worker Program requirements</strong> under Canada Express Entry and claim the additional points for Canadian experience for one year for your PR. Get ITA with increased CRS Scores.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p>Amongst so many business immigration pathways to Canada, the C11 Work Permit is the most suitable one as it offers the perfect opportunity for foreign entrepreneurs, business owners, and investors to <strong>move to Canada&nbsp;</strong>and establish their business presence. With so many benefits and promising opportunities, the C11 program is a perfect gateway to Canada without having to go through the complicated LMIA process.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Generally speaking, applying for a work permit is the first step toward attaining permanent residency status in Canada. If you are an entrepreneur or a self-employed individual seeking to <strong>work in Canada</strong>&nbsp;and eventually become a permanent resident, then the C11 entrepreneur work permit is the right choice for you.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Canada&rsquo;s International Mobility Program (IMP) has opened paths for Canadian employers to recruit temporary foreign workers without going through the Labor Market Impact Assessment (LMIA) work permit process. The same IMP program has another LMIA-exempt program called &ldquo;C11 work permit Canada&rdquo;, which permits foreign entrepreneurs and self-employed individuals to apply for a work permit without an LMIA.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2><strong>Key features and benefits of the C11 Program</strong></h2>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>The C11 Entrepreneur Work Permit was created under the International Mobility Program (IMP).</li>\r\n	<li>The work permit under the C11 category is granted for two years. However, one can extend it multiple times, provided you meet the eligibility conditions and that your business is active and profitable in Canada.</li>\r\n	<li>Self-employed entrepreneurs and business owners in Canada carrying out their businesses with the C11 work permit can apply for <strong>permanent residence in Canada.</strong></li>\r\n	<li>The work permit process remains unaffected by the LMIA process.</li>\r\n	<li>The immigration officer evaluates a business plan based on its ability to bring significant benefits to Canadians. The benefit could be related to economic stimulus, advancement of the Canadian industry, and social or cultural.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<h2><strong>Who is suitable to apply for a C11 Entrepreneur Work Permit?</strong></h2>\r\n\r\n<p>The C11 work permit is an ideal choice for the following individuals:</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>Self-employed professionals who like to start a business in Canada.</li>\r\n	<li>Foreign entrepreneurs who want to buy an existing business or franchise in Canada;</li>\r\n	<li>Individuals who were selected under any of the Entrepreneur streams of the <strong>Provincial Nominee Program.</strong></li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p>Even if you seek more information about&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>C11 Visa Canada and Canada Business Visa&nbsp;</strong>you can write an email on <strong>info@orangeglobalconsultancy.in</strong>&nbsp;and one of the most experienced immigration consultants will get in touch with you to help you out with your questions and concerns or you can also choose to call us on <strong>+91 8336933522.</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>', '', '352526517_org_img1.png', 'https://orangeglobalconsultancy.in/cms.php?type=Njg=', 1, '2023-12-26 03:38:48'),

Its resort villages and neighborhood provide the laid back existence of the finest lake living inside an easy and swift commute to the flourishing urban centre of Regina.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe said commute is not obtainable anywhere else in the entire Western Canada. The sheer variety and choice proffered by the towns &amp; resort villages is a truly out-of-the-world that Saskatchewan has to present. Several attractive choices greet visitors when staying in the Regina area.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n<strong>Residential Housing</strong><br />\r\nThe overall expenses of housing are significantly lower in the province, vis-&agrave;-vis in most top Canadian cities, even as owning a home is rather reasonably priced and attainable for majority of individuals. It means Saskatchewan is a pretty good and affordable place to move to, for work and living purposes. One can live in a comfortable house in the province without making a big hole in his pocket.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nFor those interested in hard facts, and figures, as of May 2012, the regular cost of a home in Saskatoon was $328,297. And, as of April 2012, the average rent for a two-bedroom residence in Saskatoon was $976.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n<strong>Cost of living</strong><br />\r\nThe overall cost of living in the province is not too high. Let&rsquo;s find-out how and why!<br />\r\n<br />\r\nTo begin with, unlike other provinces of Canada, in Saskatchewan one is not burdened with either personal premiums or personal expenses for primary and needed health services. The provincial sales tax of 5% is the least tax charged by any Canadian province that levies a sales tax.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nBesides, it costs less to get to and from work with the reason being the maximum commute time inside big cities is roughly just 20 minutes. Even with the blooming economy of the province, the cost of living in Saskatoon is moderately not-too-high. Vis-&agrave;-vis other similar-sized or larger cities of the nation, Saskatonians will frequently shell-out less for food, housing and utilities.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nEven as housing expenses have headed north in recent years, home ownership is still within reach for most persons. Average expenses for household utility are below average, in comparison with other leading cities of the Maple Leaf Country.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nAuto insurance rates are among the lowest in the nation, in respect of other leading cities of Canada. The expenses of travelling are low as the average travel inside Saskatoon is just 20 minutes.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe <strong>Saskatchewan Immigrant Nominee Program (SINP)</strong> enables the province to offer nomination to candidates to the federal administration, for the prized Canada permanent residency (PR).</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>SINP Entrepreneur Class</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>The Entrepreneur segment of the SINP is tailored to draw entrepreneurial talent to the said province.

(72, 181, 'Manitoba Provincial Nominee Program for Business', '<h2>MANITOBA &ndash; AT A GLANCE</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>The beautiful Canadian Province of Manitoba, located in central part of the country, is one of the three Prairie Provinces in the nation, and home to over 1,200,000 people. The largest city in the province is the capital, Winnipeg, with a population exceeding 730,000. The second largest city is Brandon, with a population of around 56,000. Manitoba has received increasing numbers of immigrants in recent years, and it has set goals of encouraging 10,000 immigrants to settle within its borders annually.<br />\r\n&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Manitoba Economy &amp; Employment</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Mining, manufacturing, agriculture these are one of the principle industries of the province even as traditionally, farming has been a major occupation for Manitobans. The rich farmlands in the Southern Manitoba produce wheat, barley, oats, sunflower, flax and canola crops, as well as dairy and livestock farms. From this agricultural base, a considerable food processing industry has emerged. Apart from this, Manitoba is home to considerable manufacturing, aerospace and transportation industries.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nWinnipeg, the capital, has a sizable financial and insurance industry, as well as government administration and services. The unemployment rate in the province is presently 5.4% well below the Canadian average of 7.0%. The economy is expected to continue its recent growth. While this should provide robust job creation, the Government of Manitoba also provides different programmes to help immigrants settle and find jobs in the province. Among these are free English as an Additional Language (EAL) classes, job preparation programmes, etc.<br />\r\n&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Manitoba Standard of Living</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Low cost of living is one of the most appealing aspects of the province and this enables one to enjoy a very comfortable life here. Housing, energy, insurance and post-secondary education in Manitoba are all among the least expensive in the country. With a lower share of income dedicated to these costs, the Manitobans have more money left over to spend on other things. One such example is a cottage/vacation home, as Manitobans have the highest rate of vacation home ownership in Canada.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe Manitobans are hooked on to Golf and play it a lot. Such a high craze for this sport cannot be found anywhere else in the nation. Manitoba has a mandatory minimum wage in Canada at 10.70 Canadian Dollars. The province also has the fourth-lowest marginal personal income tax rate in the country. Not to be underestimated, the friendly nature of the local people also contributes to the quality of life in the province.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nA very special thing about the residents is that they are very generous and volunteer at a higher rate than any other Canadian province. They also give the highest proportion of their incomes to charity. This generosity helps to create supportive communities that can help new Canadians get off to a good start in the province.<br />\r\n&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Manitoba Residential Housing</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Housing is not very expensive here and it&rsquo;s a key draw factor about residing in the region. The province&rsquo;s residential housing market is very competitive, and affordable housing is readily available. The average house price in Manitoba is 269,000 Canadian Dollars the fourth lowest average of any province in the country. The average percentage of household income taken up by ownership costs varies between 15-30%. Another benefit of the housing market is that without too much urban sprawl, one does not have to go too far outside the cities to find a good place to live. Winnipeg has the shortest average distance to commute to work of any Canadian city over 500,000 people, with an average under just six kilometres. Shorter commute means more time available to spend at home with family or taking part in other activities.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3><br />\r\n<strong>MANITOBA PROVINCIAL NOMINEE PROGRAMME</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Much like other Canadian provinces and territories, Manitoba, too, has its own provincial nominee programme, called the <strong>Manitoba Provincial Nominee Programme</strong> (MPNP). It is basically an excellent administration managed immigration scheme that chooses those candidates for migration who manage to establish that they have both the capability and the desire to move and settle themselves, along with their families, in the province.<br />\r\n&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>MPNP NOW REORGANIZED &amp; IMPROVED </strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The province has recently made numerous important changes to its PNP. The formation of an in-demand occupations list, and a new corridor allied with the nation&rsquo;s Express Entry system are just two of the main improvements made to the MPNP.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nA component of an extensive rearrangement and restoration of the MPNP, the steps are in keeping with the province&rsquo;s declared commitment to provide the new entrants with new and better trails to the prized Permanent Residence (PR) status in the province and the nation.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe improvements comprise the restructuring of three present and running immigration categories, namely, the MPNP-B Business Immigration Stream, <strong>Skilled Worker in Manitoba Stream</strong>, and Skilled Worker Overseas Stream and the making of a completely new International Education Stream.<br />\r\n&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>A. BUSINESS INVESTOR STREAM (BIS)</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Let&rsquo;s start with the Business Investor Stream (BIS) first!</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The improved Business Investor Stream (BIS) will substitute the current PNP-B business immigration category. The BIS will enable the Canadian province to sign-up and nominate those qualified foreign business investors and entrepreneurs, who are determined and possess the ability to either start or purchase businesses in the province, inside the first 24 months of landing in Canada with a Temporary Work Permit. As per the new arrangements, there won&rsquo;t any longer be the requirement&ndash;on the part of the applicants&ndash;to present a deposit of 100,000 Canadian Dollars to the Manitoba Administration.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe BIS will give preference to those candidates who launch a venture/mission inside the first 12 months of their landing in the province, particularly those keen to set-up their venture/mission outside the capital, Winnipeg.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe key motive behind the improvements seems to be generating work opportunities for the residents. Perhaps this is why the changes would guarantee that every business nominee makes investments in the ventures/firms that produce employment opportunities for the province, and makes handy contributions to its economy.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe BIS will have two pathways:</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Entrepreneur Pathway</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Meant for the candidates, eager to kick-start a firm/venture in the province, the candidates under the scheme would receive a Temporary Work Permit, and in place of proffering a good-faith deposit of 100,000 Canadian Dollars, they would ink a business performance deal. This will be done to either buy a present enterprise in the province or come up with a fresh entity.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nNot less than three years of full time work experience during the preceding 5 years, either as an active business owner or working in a senior management role of a successful business, is required. Business proprietors are given higher points, vis-&agrave;-vis high-ranking managers. To make the cut for points, it is mandatory that the business owners possess not less than 33.3 % proprietorship. The new terms &amp; conditions are listed to become effective in the first quarter of the next year.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n<strong>Investment Requirements</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<ol>\r\n	<li>The bare minimum investment will be 250,000 Canadian Dollars for the ventures/firms located in the Manitoba Capital Region.</li>\r\n	<li>In case a venture/firm is based outside of the territorial limits of the Manitoba Capital Region, the bare minimum investment will be 150,000 Canadian Dollars.</li>\r\n	<li>Making Business Investment in an entitled firm/venture as described by the MPNP is also mandatory.</li>\r\n	<li>The planned firm/venture must either generate or continue not less than 1 job for either a local Canadian Citizen or a <strong>Permanent Resident in Manitoba</strong> (this does not include the proprietors of the firm/venture and/or their close family members).</li>\r\n</ol>\r\n\r\n<h3>Farm Investor Pathway</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Meant for those planning to set-up and run a farm operation in the rural areas of the province, under the pathway, the applicants will firstly get a Temporary Work Permit. Not less than three years of farm business management or farm proprietorship and operation experience well supported by provable certificates/papers is required. They will get nomination for Permanent Residence (PR) when they successfully set-up a firm/venture, which fulfills the different terms &amp; conditions of a Business Performance Agreement.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n<strong>Investment Requirements</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<ol>\r\n	<li>An investment of not less than 150,000 Canadian Dollars is required. You must also set-up a farming business in the rural areas of the province.</li>\r\n	<li>It is mandatory that the farm business investments are ineligible physical assets as described by the MPNP.</li>\r\n	<li>You need to have a farm business plan even as it&rsquo;s a vital component of the petition.</li>\r\n	<li>Investments in a farm business run and managed mainly for the objects of getting either passive investment income or hypothetical objects are not qualified.</li>\r\n	<br />\r\n	<li>&nbsp;</li>\r\n</ol>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>B. MANITOBA SKILLED WORKER IMMIGRATION STEREAM</strong><br />\r\n<br />\r\nIt has two streams, namely, the Skilled Workers Overseas Stream, and the Skilled Workers in Manitoba Stream both of these run under the MPNP Expression of Interest (EoI) System. Under the same, qualified applicants complete some questions online only to get a total, on the basis of the answers they offer.&nbsp;Those who get the highest scores obtain invites to present a petition to the MPNP.&nbsp;There are not any restrictions on the figure of the aspirants who may present an EoI and no deadline.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n<strong>Important</strong>: The eligibility requirements for the two classes continue to remain in effect as of now.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>The Process</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The (EOI) system of the province has a three-step process.</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li><strong>Number 1</strong>: Probable applicants make an EoI in moving to Manitoba via answering a chain of questions and making a profile online. The profiles of eligible applicants are assigned a total on the basis of the answers given only to be put in the Pool for Manitoba EOI with other qualified aspirants. Applicants are given a position on the basis of the unique MPNP Ranking Points system and proffered a total out of a maximum of 1,000 points up-for-grabs.</li>\r\n	<li><strong>Number 2</strong>: Those who get the highest scores can be sent an invite to apply to the programme. When a person is drawn from the EOI pool, he or she gets a Letter of Advice to Apply (LAA). Post getting a LAA, applicants will have just 60 days left to present a complete and correct petition to Manitoba.</li>\r\n	<li><strong>Number 3</strong>: Post receiving a nomination from Manitoba, a person presents his or her complete paperwork to&nbsp;the Immigration, Refugees and Citizenship Canada (IRCC)&nbsp;and submits an application for Permanent Residence in the country.</li>\r\n	<br />\r\n	<li>&nbsp;</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>SKILLED WORKERS OVERSEAS STREAM</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>A key change is the launch of a new in-demand occupations list that will be utilized to prioritize the EOI, for the object of sending invites to the petitions, from the new Skilled Worker Overseas category. What is an EOI? In order to submit an application to the <strong>Manitoba Provincial Nominee Programme for Business</strong> (MPNP- B), it is required that a potential applicant puts forward an EOI and gets a counsel from the MPNP-B to submit an application. While an EOI is not an application, there are no charges whatsoever for the submission of an EOI. An EOI specifies that you are keen to be mulled over for a Nomination Application to the MPNP-B.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nUnder the new arrangement, it will be further divided into two corridors, namely, the <strong>Manitoba Express Entry Pathway</strong>, and the Human Capital Pathway.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Manitoba Express Entry Pathway</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>This pathway may start entertaining petitions in January 2018. Those who may have the necessary qualifications under a MPNP category, and who also fulfill the different requirements for Express Entry,&nbsp;and have a dynamic Express Entry profile can apply under it. In all likelihood, the first draw to be carried-out, via the pathway would occur somewhere in the beginning of next year, 2018.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe applicants for Express Entry who obtain a provincial nomination, via an Express Entry-aligned stream, also called an enhanced nomination or stream could get 600 extra <strong>Comprehensive Ranking System (CRS) Points</strong>. An Invitation to Apply (ITA) for the prized PR at a federal Express Entry draw may also come their way.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Human Capital Pathway</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>It is basically tailored for the international skilled worker candidates who have the necessary abilities and training as necessitated by the In-demand Occupations list, and who illustrate a good possibility for setting themselves up in their chosen vocations as soon as possible, post landing in the province. Besides other requirements, family links or previous post-secondary or employment experience in the province, during the preceding 5 years, are required to make the cut for the class.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n<strong>SKILLED WORKERS IN MANITOBA STREAM </strong><br />\r\n<br />\r\nUnder the class, petitions are admitted from the skilled temporary overseas manpower and international student graduates who are presently doing a job in the province and have a permanent work with their Manitoba recruiter /firm. Unlike the other links to the province in the MPNP, Skilled Workers in Manitoba are not subject to a points-based evaluation to decide their eligibility or otherwise. It is mandatory that the applicants fulfill the minimum requirements to be entered into the pool for EoI where they will be given a position on the basis of many factors.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nUnder the latest arrangement, the Skilled Workers in Manitoba Stream will also be subdivided into two pathways, namely, the Manitoba Work Experience Pathway, and Employer Direct Recruitment Pathway.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Manitoba Work Experience Pathway</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>It is meant for those presently working in the province armed with temporary work permits, and whose jobs do not find mention on the In-demand Occupations list. The candidates could be International Students who are out-of-province graduates, and the International Students who are Manitoba graduates involved with jobs not mentioned on the province&rsquo;s published in-demand occupations list.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n<strong><em>Requirements</em></strong><br />\r\n<br />\r\nIt is mandatory that the candidates validate both the capacity and determination to live in the province.

People who apply for a <strong>Canada PR Visa</strong>&nbsp;must know about the average Salary a person makes in Canada to maintain a stable life and better career opportunities. Irrespective of the work experience and the profile in which you are working, Canada offers an average salary to its residents and citizens per month to lead a comfortable life. A person working full-time in Canada typically earns an average salary of 120,000 CAD&nbsp;per year. The Average Salary in Canada ranges from 30,200 CAD&nbsp;to 534,000 CAD.&nbsp; The average wage includes housing, transportation, and other benefits. How much compensation you earn in Canada also depends on your profile, sector, and industry type.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2><strong>Median Salary</strong></h2>\r\n\r\n<p>The Median Salary is 112,000 CAD per year, which means that 50% of the population earns less than 112,000 CAD while the other half earns more than the said amount.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2><strong>What is the difference between the average and the median salary?</strong></h2>\r\n\r\n<p>Both the median and the average Salary are the indicators of your growth in Canada. If your Salary is above the average and the median, you are doing quite well in Canada. Whereas, if your Salary is lower, then there is a scope for improvement. Median and the average salaries are measures of the &quot;middle of the market&quot; regarding compensation.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Organizations in Canada target employees at either the average wage in Canada&nbsp;or the median rate without compromising the company&#39;s overall operational cost. Your Salary also depends on your education, level of skills, and experience.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2><strong>Average Salary in each Canadian province</strong></h2>\r\n\r\n<p>Canada has ten provinces and three territories. Each province is different in economy, demographic conditions, employment opportunities, workforce availability, and wages. Since their economy is diverse, the Average Salary in Toronto will differ from Regina, which is in Saskatchewan. Therefore, before you pick a provincial nominee program for immigration, it&#39;s crucial to know the average Salary an individual earns in a specific province.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Typically, average salaries remain higher in the following provinces:</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>Ontario</li>\r\n	<li>Alberta</li>\r\n	<li>British Columbia, and</li>\r\n	<li>Quebec</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p>The salaries mentioned in the above table are subject to change depending on your experience and expertise. Your qualification and knowledge of the job market influence your average salary in Canada per month or year. The salary levels are also based on the location and the career field.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2><strong>What are the highest-paying jobs in Canada?</strong></h2>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>Specialist Physicians- $117, 00-$375,000</li>\r\n	<li>Mining, Oil and Gas Extraction- $113,506.12</li>\r\n	<li>Dentists- $168237</li>\r\n	<li>Professional, Scientific, and Technical Services- $76,077.56</li>\r\n	<li>Senior Managers in Finance and Communication- $77,805 &ndash; $129,629</li>\r\n	<li>Airline pilots&nbsp;&ndash; $35,233 &ndash; $146,274</li>\r\n	<li>Senior Software Engineer- &nbsp;CA$109,737</li>\r\n	<li>Public Administration- $75,799.88</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p>Hopefully, the salaries mentioned above have encouraged you to learn about <strong>Canada PR requirements</strong>&nbsp;from India.

Every year millions of travelers, immigrants, business people, diplomats, newcomers, students, and refugees travel to Canada. Due to the Canada Visa process&#39;s lenient nature, people can enter the country without any hurdles or hindrances. However, under the garb of immigration solutions, several agencies or individuals commit fraudulent practices that crush people&#39;s dream of migrating. With a greater demand for Canadian Visa, the rise of phony consultancies is inevitable. To prevent such activities, the Government has a fool-proof mechanism to counter these malicious actions.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The below sections will discuss the types of Immigration fraud, countermeasures, and the newcomer&#39;s rights.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong><u>BEWARE OF THE BELOW LIST OF FRAUDS</u></strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong><u>Fraud one</u></strong></p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li><strong>Fake claims of having RCIC agents on websites</strong> &ndash; The majority of Immigration consultants outside India claim association with a Canada-based licensed RCIC agent who will act as the authorized representative for their clients. In most cases, that is just a photo opportunity.</li>\r\n	<li><strong>What to do </strong>&ndash; Check out the ICCRC website link&nbsp;and ask the local consultant meets all the mentioned guidelines. The retainer agreement has to be signed with the RCIC agent and not the local company or agent. The local immigration consultant&#39;s name should be mentioned alongside the RCIC agent&rsquo;s name on the ICCRC website.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p><strong><u>Fraud Two</u></strong></p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li><strong>Fake Government Officials</strong> &ndash; Some people may pose as a government official on the phone and scare the applicants for insufficient documents and fee dues. They further intimidate you by indicating that you can lose your residency status or be deported if you do not pay.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li><strong><em>What to do &ndash; </em></strong><em>You must ask the name of the person calling before disconnecting the call. Then you must confirm it with the Immigration Call Centre to verify whether the call was genuine or not. You can file a complaint report it to the Canadian Anti-Fraud Centre.</em></li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p><strong><u>Fraud Three</u></strong></p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li><strong>Fake websites and Internet Scams </strong>&ndash; Nowadays, it&#39;s straightforward to copy and replicate a real website to build a professional one. They may claim that they have special immigration deals, guaranteed high-paying jobs, and partnerships with the Immigration department. They would ask for your details and upfront fees.</li>\r\n	<li><strong><em>What to do &ndash; </em></strong><em>Always remember, if someone is guaranteeing you Canada PR Visa<strong>, </strong>then it&#39;s a scam. Always check the website whether they have &quot;https://&quot; and padlock in the browser window.</em></li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p><strong><u>Fraud Four</u></strong></p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li><strong>Fake Immigration Emails &ndash; </strong>There is a chance that you may receive emails that closely resemble the immigration department&#39;s pattern. Then, they would ask for personal information and bank details.</li>\r\n	<li><strong><em>What to do </em></strong><em>&ndash; Beware of this scam. Canadian Government would never any personal or bank details. Ensure that you have received an email from the &quot;gc.ca&quot; or &quot;Canada.ca&quot; email account. Scam mails usually designate as &quot;Dear customer or Dear Client,&quot; wherein official correspondence would address the client&#39;s full name.</em></li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p><strong><u>Fraud Five</u></strong></p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li><strong>Fake Emails &ndash; </strong>You may receive several emails requesting your personal information and to invest money.</li>\r\n	<li><strong><em>What to do </em></strong><em>&ndash; Identify those mails and delete them. A legitimate investing organization never sends bulk emails to random people. Do not click any links provided in the mail and verify the sender of the mail.</em></li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p><strong><u>Fraud Six</u></strong></p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li><strong>Fake Computer Virus &ndash; </strong>It is common in Canada that people receive several calls stating that their computer / Laptop/tablet is infected with the virus. They will lure you into getting your passwords and other relevant information.</li>\r\n	<li><strong><em>What to do &ndash; </em></strong><em>Never give access to your computers / Laptops/tablets to any random calls or text. You must always take your laptop to professional shops or install an anti-virus for a nominal fee.</em></li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p><strong><u>Fraud Seven</u></strong></p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li><strong>Fake Prizes &ndash; </strong>Commonly, people receive several phones, text or email that states that you have won a lottery or jackpot. Then, they would ask your bank details which are most likely to be a scam. Further, they would ask you to respond &quot;STOP&quot; or &quot;NO&quot; to stop these messages, but in reality, they confirm whether you have a real phone number.<em> </em></li>\r\n	<li><strong><em>What to do &ndash; </em></strong><em>Be vigilant and never give any details to any stranger. Forward these texts to 7726, wherein your phone provider will block future texts from those numbers.</em></li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p><strong><u>Fraud Eight</u></strong></p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li><strong>Marriage Fraud &ndash; </strong>It is common these days that people from another country marry Canadian Permanent Residents to attain Canadian Residency quickly. Suppose you are a Canadian Permanent Resident or Citizen who just met someone from another country and wish to marry her/him. You need to identify that person&#39;s ulterior motive, mostly when you just met online. Conduct background checks and family information. If you move forward with the marriage, you can sponsor your spouse to Canada. However, if the marriage fails, you must give them financial support for three years, and if your spouse uses social assistance, you need to repay the money. It&#39;s a crime for a foreign national to marry a Canadian citizen or permanent resident to enter Canada. If your spouse uses social assistance, you will have to repay the money. As per the law, it is a crime for a foreign national to marry a Canadian citizen or permanent resident for the sole purpose of gaining entry to Canada.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p><strong><u>Fraud Nine</u></strong></p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li><strong>Documentation Fraud &ndash; </strong>Document fraud involves submitting false or altered documents to the immigration office such as passports, travel documents, academic degrees, and certificates of birth, marriage, final divorce, annulment, death, or PCC. If you lie in an immigration interview with an IRCC officer, it is also considered fraud. If you are caught, they will ban you from entering Canada for a minimum of 5 years, attest a permanent record of fraud, strip your permanent residency or citizenship status, and charge you with a crime or deport. Check with your Authorized <strong>Canada Immigration&nbsp;</strong>Consultants for an accurate documentation process.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p><strong><u>Fraud Ten</u></strong></p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li><strong>Adoption Fraud &ndash; </strong>If you wish to adopt a child from a foreign country, you must follow Provincial / Territorial governments&#39; laws, The Government of Canada, and the land of adoption.

The first step in this process is the filling and filing of this application at the Quebec Immigration Visa Post. Take note that all the incomplete applications are rejected. Relevant mandatory documents have to be provided with the application for it to be processed further. Based on the credentials and documents provided by you, it would be decided by the visa officer, whether or not you qualify for the next stage.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nA personal interview is an important part of the selection procedure. This interview is conducted for the visa officer to assess you as a potential migrant.

For security checks, you would be expected to present documents which prove your identity as well as civil status. A police clearance certificate should also be accompanied with these documents. In case of medical clearances, a medical examination by a physician is required. This physician should have been approved by Citizen and Immigration Canada.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe Permanent Resident Visa would be issued to you after it is approved by the federal authorities.

The most common types of work permits are:</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>Temporary Foreign Worker Program</li>\r\n	<li>Facilitated LMIA (Quebec)</li>\r\n	<li>Global Talent Stream</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p>Under the TFWP, Canadian employers may recruit temporary foreign workers through the following pathways:</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>High-wage workers</li>\r\n	<li>Low-wage workers</li>\r\n	<li>Global Talent Stream</li>\r\n	<li>Foreign agricultural workers</li>\r\n	<li>In-home Caregivers</li>\r\n	<li>Foreign Academics</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<h2><strong>How to get a job in Canada from India?</strong></h2>\r\n\r\n<p>Getting a job in Canada is all about promoting your skills and how well you can immerse yourself into the new culture and environment. The best ways to get a job in Canada are:</p>\r\n\r\n<h3><strong>Create a professional resume</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>When we discuss creating a resume, we typically mean drafting a CV unique to each job profile and company. Every job description has distinct requirements that applicants must meet to land a job offer and, eventually work permit from India. Make sure your CV reflects all your skills, core competencies, and everything that makes you an ideal for the job advertised. Your CV should be designed per Canadian standards and contain all necessary keywords and pointers to generate maximum response.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3><strong>Pick the suitable sources for jobs</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>With the availability of social media platforms and numerous job portals, it has become easier to promote yourself to employers. All you need is the proper knowledge and right resource to do so. Job portals and social media platforms such as LinkedIn have become increasingly popular among job seekers and employers. However, in the context of Canada, foreign workers must not blindly believe every job offer they encounter as there are frauds as well. So, make sure you opt for a reliable source such as Job Bank, ca.indeed.com, Canadajobs.com, etc., for job hunting.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3><strong>Build your network</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>You can start building your network even before Canada Immigration&nbsp;and look for a job. A strong network goes a long way in giving you access to the Canadian job market. Effective networking is an essential part of your job search activity that you must go for during your job hunting. Networking also helps you know about vacancies that are not yet advertised, but only if you have built the right connections.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2><strong>What documents do I need to apply for a Canadian work permit?</strong></h2>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>Copy of passport with at least six months&rsquo; validity</li>\r\n	<li>Two recent passport-sized photographs</li>\r\n	<li>Job offer letter from a Canadian employer</li>\r\n	<li>Evidence that you meet the requirements for your prospective job</li>\r\n	<li>Evidence that you meet the basic Work permit Canada requirements</li>\r\n	<li>Documents related to your education qualifications and work experience</li>\r\n	<li>Proof of funds through bank statements</li>\r\n	<li>Medical examination and PCC certification</li>\r\n	<li>Receipt of application fee</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p>Even if you seek more information about&nbsp;<strong>Canada Work Visa&nbsp;</strong>you can write an email on info@orangeglobalconsultancy.in&nbsp;and one of the most experienced immigration consultants will get in touch with you to help you out with your questions and concerns or you can also choose to call us on +91-8336933522.</p>', '', '830098844_org_img1.png', 'https://orangeglobalconsultancy.in/cms.php?type=ODU=', 1, '2023-12-27 02:18:06'),

In addition, the IRCC plans to conduct its first batch of category-based lotteries for STEM professionals in the following week.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>IRCC had selected new categories based on labor market assessment, including projections and feedback from stakeholders nationwide.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The immigration department used this information to develop six new categories for Express Entry in the upcoming draws in the coming months.

A duly validated employment offer is compulsory to gain state sponsorship.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Q: Can I change my visa subcategory after the EOI lodgment?</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Answer :</strong>&nbsp;Yes, you can do so! It is possible to update your EOI with any details through the two year time. You will gain an opportunity to keep updating your profile in Skill Select anytime when you wish. You also have the right to generate on your EOI continuously as your papers/certificates ought to be with more employment experience.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Q: Should the ACS &amp; the IELTS be legitimate at the time of invitation?</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Answer :</strong> Yes! However, in the backdrop of the fact that the EOI will be held in the bank for two years, the same may not pose any issues to most of the candidates. Still, in certain cases where individuals have gone through the skills assessment/IELTS much before the EOI lodgment, the same could present some problems, particularly for the IELTS. It also denotes that the EOI should be filed in as soon as the results for the IELTS &amp; skills evaluation are obtainable. In case a decision is not made inside two years, the petition will cease to be part of EOI bank. The ACS skills appraisal will also expire post two years, and in case the candidate is eager to re-file, he will require getting evaluation done. He will also have to present a fresh EOI submission. Though the EOI form talks about the IELTS report has a validity of 36 months, the IELTS report has a validity of two years.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Q: Are there separate lists of professions for State sponsored &amp;Regional sponsored, or is it advisable to follow one list?</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Answer :</strong> There are two types of occupations lists. One is the <strong>Occupations lists</strong>&nbsp;with Schedule 1 and 2 which is called CSOL. For independent skilled migration, the professions given in SOL 1 For State Sponsored and <strong>Regional</strong>&nbsp;<strong>Schemes</strong>, only Schedule 2 professions can be duly followed. Apart from this, in case of state and regional programs, it is essential that the claimed line-of-work is also given in state/regional lists. Against this backdrop, for independent skilled overseas movement, you will refer to the professions given in SOL 1, and for state/regional sponsorship, you will refer to Schedule 1 and &nbsp;2 AND state lists.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Q: What&rsquo;s the basis of selection from the EOI? Is it entirely based on points?</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Answer :</strong> It is based in ranking inside the pool which will keep on changing. In the backdrop of the fact that an EOI submission can be analyzed by recruiters/state/federal bureaus, the EOI may not be wholly based on points.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In case a recruiter/firm or state is happy with a profile that occupies a not-too-high position in the pool ranking, the same will still be preferred. Still, it is essential that every selected profile fulfills the bare minimum points-requirement &ndash; 60 or 65 points whatever the case could be.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Q: How the petition shall be selected from the EOI bank and what&rsquo;s the estimated time period?</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Answer :</strong> The submission will be in the bank for a period of two years, and can be seen anytime during the two years time.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The petition will be chosen from the bank depending on when the same is chosen and duly shortlisted by a recruiter/state/region/federal bureau.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The submission will be given a position, on the basis of the points that you obtain. The ranking will continue to undergo changes as fresh petitions continue to land in the pool. Hence, the petitions that could be gaining higher points (65 points or above) will occupy a higher rank. At certain times, the ranking may be decided by the line-of-work to which a candidate belongs to, even while those who are from extreme shortage profession could be given higher ranks.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>There is NO estimated time period that can be given to a candidate. His profile can be chosen at any time, or not chosen at all for the duration of the two years for which his profile will occupy a place in the pool. In case he is not chosen, he loses the amount spent on Skills appraisal, and the IELTS Test, and also what he has offered as consulting charges.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Q: The states continue to improve the laws, and in case the EOI is shown today with an one specific set of requirements then what will take place in case it takes a very long time even as the state concludes the quota or amends any conditions?</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Answer :</strong> Generally, the states follow the set of rules fixed by the Federal/Central Government, except for picking up the professions they prefer for sponsorship, and the IELTS test requirement for every line-of-work. Save for these two areas, the states are powerless to do much about &ldquo;regulatory&rdquo; improvements. The eventual visa is proffered by the federal/central administration, irrespective of state/regional administration rules.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Q: Does profession has no meaning at all in case of a family member sponsorship?</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Answer :</strong> It is essential that the aspirant belongs to either Schedule 1. It is also vital that the relative is residing in the chosen area.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Q: Is the sub-category 489 a 4-year or a 3-year permit? Can I submit a petition for the PR Permit on the basis of the present laws or the one that will prevail post 3 or 4 years? Shall I file a petition before my permit loses its validity?</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Answer :</strong> <strong>Sub-class 489</strong> is a 4-year Permit. You will be qualified to submit a petition for PR on the basis of the laws applicable at the time of submitting your submission. You have the right to file a petition pose two years for PR after arriving in the state/region, but prior to the end of 4 years when your permit loses its validity.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Q: In the case of state sponsorship, the major candidate, partner, and kids will stay and do a job in the specific state. However, can kids pursue studies outside that state&rsquo;s territorial limits?</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Answer :</strong> It is very doubtful that the advantages of funded education will be obtainable outside the states that have offered sponsorship to the candidate. It is important that the family resides in the selected state/region for which the particular permit was offered.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Q: What to do in case I come across some technical difficulties while employing Skill Select?</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Answer :</strong> Such circumstances are not uncommon. But no need to worry! , You are advised to visit the Support page of the Skill Select before pressing the button given for the &lsquo;<strong>Skill Select Support</strong>&rsquo;. The same will provide all-inclusive data, comprising Skill Select user guides, technical FAQs, etc. You will not have more than one chance to access your EOI account. Besides, you can only mention 1 e-mail address so that you can remain in touch with Skill Select for any invitation objects.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Q: What is the compulsory pass marks meant for the points based permits?</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Answer :</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<ol>\r\n	<li>Visa subclasses 189, 190 and 489 &ndash; 60 points;</li>\r\n	<li>Visa subclasses 885, 886 and 487 - 65 points;</li>\r\n	<li>Visa Subclass 188 (business innovation &amp; investment visa) - 65 points</li>\r\n</ol>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Q: Who accesses the specifics of the Skill Select&rsquo; aspirants?</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Answer :</strong> This actually depends on the choices(s) made by the candidate in the EOI petition. In case you have settled for an employer sponsored or state or regional permit, employer/state/regional may review your profile in the EOI bank. In case you have opted for the independent or family sponsored permit, Skill Select will exclusively utilize your specifics.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Q: Can I submit an EOI, even if am yet to sail through the language test for English &amp; skills evaluation from the relatedorganization?</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Answer :</strong> Before you submit a completed EOI, and in case you are pre-setting an EOI for a points based permit, successfully clear the test meant for the English language &amp; also skills appraisal. Even if you may not be required to attach the germane papers to the EOI, present the correct data in your EOI. Guarantee that it is similar to the one given on the supporting documents.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Q: Can a candidate find-out his ranking in the EOI pool?</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Answer :</strong> No! It cannot be done. The ranking position continues to undergo key changes, thanks to the filing or the withdrawal of other EOIs from the Skill Select.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Q: Can I present an EOI in Australia?</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Answer :</strong> Yes of course! But you need to satisfy the pre-decided conditions. It needs to be borne in mind that the EOI is not a permit submission, and you will not be given a bridging permit/visa. In case you gain an invite to present a visa submission, you have to satisfy the requirements to get the visa.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Q: Is it compulsory to offer a written statement in the EOI?</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Answer :</strong> The answer is in the negative. The EOI will ask questions--the basis of which will be the permit you may be interested in. Your answer will have adequate statistics for your EOI to be successfully presented.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Q: In case I fail to get an invite, can I be get my money back spent for the skills appraisal&amp; the language test for English?</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Answer :</strong> The answer again is in the negative. Only because you have filed an EOI does not mean you will get an invite. You, as an applicant, have to bear the expenses while preparing your EOI and in case the petition fails to get selected from the pool then you will not gain any refund whatsoever for the expenses incurred for appearing for the IELTS Test &amp; assessment for skills.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Q: What to do if the situation, circumstances, or information undergoes any improvements, post the submission of my EOI?</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Answer :</strong> Update you EOI to depict any freshly gained qualification or experience that may have come your way even while the SkillSelect will notice it, and in case appropriate, will automatically update your position.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Q: What if an invitation is not mailed to me to submit a submission for permit, will I have the review rights?</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Answer :</strong> You will be denied the right in such a case. The review process is meant for only those qualified people whose submissions for a permit have been dismissed. In this case, the EOI is not a permit submission.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Q: Are some other avenues available that I can utilize for posting objects?</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Answer :</strong> Frankly, NO! You can only use the online facility Skill Select for EOI submission. Aspirants, who are sent in invitations to file a petition for a permit/visa, the particulars given in the EOI will be exploited as part of their petitions. It is vital that the aspirants suitably verify their claims and present evidence when they suitably submit a petition.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Q: Can I employ the professional services of an immigration agent of Australia, for the object of presenting the EOI petition and, in case the petition is chosen out of the EOI bank, for the remaining part of the immigration procedure?</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Answer : </strong>Yes you can!

For one, sponsorship is required and it is mandatory that a firm is ready to sponsor the visa applicant. The sponsoring firm must prove that it&rsquo;s obligatory to have the applicant. For the next option, it is compulsory that the candidate has a skill which is in such high demand in the nation that the Australian administration is ready to offer an invitation to the skilled applicant having the necessary skills.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Australia PR Visa</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>It is a &quot;Permanent Resident&quot; visa that is only available to those who are not Australian citizens.

When this period is up, the candidate must take a citizenship test and complete a few more requirements. It can take anywhere from 3-12 months.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It should be noted that a PR visa can be revoked at the discretion of a competent minister if the holder is found guilty of a criminal offense.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Australia PR Visa Categories</strong><br />\r\n<br />\r\nTake a look at the below mentioned are the different types of visa category which you can choose from as part of the <strong>Australia PR</strong>!</p>\r\n\r\n<p>1) Skill Based PR Employer Nomination Scheme Subclass 186 Visa</p>\r\n\r\n<p>2) Skilled Independent Subclass 189 Visa</p>\r\n\r\n<p>3) Business Innovation and Investment Subclass 188 Visa</p>\r\n\r\n<p>4) Regional Sponsored Migration Scheme Subclass 187 Visa</p>\r\n\r\n<p>5) Business Talent Visa Subclass 132 Visa 6) Skilled Nominated Visa Subclass 190 Visa</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Work Visas may be either permanent or temporary, depending on the state-of-affairs and <strong>immigration system</strong>.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThose who manage to get the required cut-off o points get an Invitation to Apply (ITA) for Australia Immigration and Permanent Residency (PR) though getting an ITA is no guarantee that one will certainly get an Australia immigration visa.

Skilled immigration programs target prospective immigrants who can contribute to the local labour market by filling vacancies for in-demand occupations, which the local Australian population is unable to fill. These &lsquo;in-demand occupations&rsquo; are outlined in the Queensland Skilled Occupation Lists (QSOL).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>There are various QSOLs, each of which details the occupation demand for specific candidate profiles.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The <strong>QSOL &lsquo;Offshore&rsquo; List</strong> showcases the occupational shortages in Queensland that can only be filled by overseas skilled workers who wish to live and work in the state.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The <strong>QSOL &lsquo;Masters Graduate&rsquo; List</strong> targets employable international postgraduate alumni from Queensland-based academic institutions.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The <strong>QSOL &lsquo;Working in Queensland&rsquo; List</strong> contains occupations whose demand must be satisfied by migrants who are currently living and working in Queensland, practicing their skilled occupation or a closely-related occupation.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Having an occupation that features on the relevant Skilled Occupation List one of the eligibility requirements for skilled workers or international students pursuing visa pathways to immigrate to Queensland. Applicants also have to undergo Skills Assessment from the relevant authority in Australia.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Each occupation on the list has a corresponding ANZSCO code and assessment authority. ANZSCO is the <em>Australian and New Zealand Standard Classification of Occupations</em>, which classifies occupations based on the skill level and qualifications required to practice them. The aspirant must first identify the ANZSCO code of their nominated occupation, and accordingly determine which assessment authority will conduct their Skills Assessment.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The&nbsp;<strong>Queensland Skilled Occupation Lists (QSOL)</strong>&nbsp;reflect the current labour demand for positions throughout Queensland.

It&rsquo;s a way to provide families opportunities to establish their roots in the country and prosper together. Keeping this in mind, the Department of Home Affairs in Australia offers a range of family visas to help Australian citizens and permanent residents to bring their dependent family members, parents, partners, and children in Australia on a temporarily or permanent basis. These visas are specifically sponsored by the Australian citizens or permanent residents, and eligible New Zealand citizens.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br />\r\n<strong>Various Family Visa Categories</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Following are the different categories of family visas that the sponsoring person may choose from to bring their family members/dependents to Australia:&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>Partner visa</li>\r\n	<li>Prospective marriage visa</li>\r\n	<li>Parent visa</li>\r\n	<li>Child</li>\r\n	<li>Other family visa</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p><br />\r\nLet&rsquo;s discuss all categories of Family visa Australia in detail:<br />\r\n&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Partner Visa-</strong> <strong>Temporary and Permanent Visa</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Also known as Subclass 801, the Partner Visa for Australia allows the spouse or de facto partner of an Australian citizen or permanent resident to migrate to Australia. The visa is applicable for married partners, same sex partners, and or a fianc&eacute;e/fianc&eacute; of an Australian citizen, or an eligible New Zealand citizen.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Your application for Partner Visa to Australia must be lodged or sponsored by your partner already living in Australia for a period of two years.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Basic Requirements for Partner Visa Australia</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>You are eligible to apply for the partner visa Australia if you meet the following requirements:</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>Both partners must be 18 years of age or above;</li>\r\n	<li>The applicant must be spouse/fianc&eacute;/ de facto partner of the person residing in Australia.&nbsp;</li>\r\n	<li>Your spouse must be able to sponsor you for at least two years.</li>\r\n	<li>For married couples, it is important to prove your relationship for more than 12 months as well as legit under the Australian Law.</li>\r\n	<li>For de facto partners, they must demonstrate the length of your relationship for at least 12 months.</li>\r\n	<li>Must provide sufficient proofs to establish the credibility of your<strong> </strong>relationship.</li>\r\n	<li>Must satisfy health and character requirements.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Prospective Marriage Visa (Subclass 300)</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The prospective marriage visa for Australia is created for people who want to get married to an Australia permanent resident&nbsp;or citizen or an eligible New Zealand citizen. The visa is valid for 9 months only, during which you must marry your prospective partner.

To apply for this visa, the parents of the child must be dead, incapacitated or unable to found.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Dependent Child Visa (Subclass 445)- </strong>The stream is applicable for children whose parents are the holders of temporary partner visa, and in the process of obtaining the permanent visa in Australia.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Basic Requirements of Child Visa:</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>To be eligible for child visa Australia, you must:</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>Be dependent on sponsored parents who are Australian permanent residents or citizens, or eligible New Zealand citizen.</li>\r\n	<li>The child must be over 18 years of age or under 25 years.</li>\r\n	<li>Be not married to anyone or in a de facto relationship</li>\r\n	<li>Must meet health and character requirements along with parents applying for this visa</li>\r\n	<li>be either a biological/adopted /step-child of the parent who holds temporary partner visa.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Other Family Visa</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Other family visa pathways are created for dependent relatives, caregivers, and other relatives of residents and citizens of Australia and New Zealand.

(134, 104, 'The UK scale-up visa route for talented foreign immigrants', '<div>\r\n<p>The government of the United Kingdom unleashed a new visa route last week, known as the Scale-up Worker Visa Route. The Scale-Up worker visa permits talented and highly-qualified overseas workers to come to the United Kingdom to work in an eligible job recruited by a UK Scale-up Sponsor. Successful applicants can work for fast-growing UK businesses, called scale-up businesses.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The UK Home Office launched a new pathway to welcome skilled professionals across the globe, including India. The latest statistics by the British government also unveiled that Indians dominated the UK immigration under skilled visa streams with excellent numbers.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Launched recently from August 2022, the UK scale-up visa route is a way in which you can work in a qualified job for a swiftly growing business in the UK. This should happen for a minimum duration of 6 months and this route allows the UK businesses undergoing fast growth to recruit highly skilled overseas workers and they be the best ones.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The holders of the UK scale-up visa route can leave their role of being sponsored after 6 months and move or transfer to an unsponsored role. In order to get UK scale-up visa you should have your occupation present on the list of qualified occupations which are in demand.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In that case your employer should be able to provide 4-digit occupation code for your role. This can be used to check as in whether or not your selected job is qualified. This visa route is to attract top class talent. This in turn pumps up the innovation gene in to the UK business stream. Only the very highly skilled&rdquo; and &ldquo;academically elite&rdquo; have the qualification for this visa.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The latest Scale-up Visa is directed at high-growth businesses to recruit the best and the brightest talent. The visa will benefit many Indians by allowing UK companies to leverage the vast pool of talented Indian professionals.&nbsp;The Scale-Up visa leads to settlement in the UK. Applicants can include their partner and dependent children in the application.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Potential applicants will need a sponsor to be eligible for the scale-up visa. Your employer must fulfill the basic eligibility before sponsoring you for the visa.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2><strong>Requirements for a Scale-up Visa &ndash; Sponsored Application </strong></h2>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>Have a confirmed job offer from the UK with a validity of at least six months.</li>\r\n	<li>Have a valid Certificate of Sponsorship issued by the UK-based Sponsor for the job you intend to do. The certificate must also contain information regarding the job role you have been offered.</li>\r\n	<li>Your salary must be equal to or exceed both &pound;33,000 per year, &pound;10.58 per hour, and the &#39;going rate for the job;</li>\r\n	<li>Your Certificate of Sponsorship must have been issued no more than three months before your&nbsp;Scale-up Visa&nbsp;Sponsored Application date.</li>\r\n	<li>Show English language proficiency of at least CEFR Level B1.</li>\r\n	<li>Have sufficient funds to manage your expenses in the UK.&nbsp;</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p>Your certificate of sponsorship must contain the below information:</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>Your name, job position, and salary;</li>\r\n	<li>Confirmation that you will work for your Sponsor for at least six months;</li>\r\n	<li>Confirmation that the Certificate of Sponsorship:\r\n	<ul style=\"list-style-type:circle\">\r\n		<li>&nbsp;Has not been used in a previous application that was either issued or refused;</li>\r\n		<li>&nbsp;Has not been withdrawn either by the Sponsor or denied by the Home Office.</li>\r\n	</ul>\r\n	</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<h2><strong>Eligibility requirements for approved UK employers 2022</strong></h2>\r\n\r\n<p>Employers must meet the following eligibility requirements:</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>To be called a Scale-up business, the company must demonstrate growth of 20% or more in either employment or turnover year-on-year for at least three years;</li>\r\n	<li>Employed a minimum of 10 people at the start of the three years</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<h2><strong>Financial Funds for Scale-up Visa</strong></h2>\r\n\r\n<p>The applicant must have &pound;1,270 or more in their bank account and must have held these funds for at least 28 consecutive days before applying. Applicants already residing in the UK for one or more years are exempt from this requirement.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2><strong>Scale Up Visa- Sponsored and Unsponsored Route</strong></h2>\r\n\r\n<p>One thing that makes the Scale-Up a standout pathway is its ability to give flexibility to applicants to work under any employer after six months in the UK. The applicant is not obliged to work under the employer who sponsored them initially and can switch jobs after the initial six-month period. If you are wondering how to immigrate to UK, the scale-up visa is the pathway for you.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This kind of provision offers considerable flexibility to visa holders as most employers in the UK do not hold sponsor licenses. Thus, it opens a wide range of employment opportunities for the applicant.&nbsp;You can even become self-employed after a period of 6 months and those who change their job or employer post 6 months need not apply for a new visa. But despite this, you shall need to meet the requirements of salary when you think of applying for visa extension.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Those who switch jobs after six months&#39; completion need not apply for a new visa. However, they must satisfy the minimum wage requirement while applying for a visa extension.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>However, suppose you want to change your job&nbsp;within the first six months&nbsp;after the approval of your scale-up visa. In that case, you will need to inform the Home Office by submitting an online application regarding your scale-up visa status update. Please note that your new employer must be a scale-up employer.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3><strong>How Can Orange Global Consultancy Immigration Services Help?</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Our team of talented and experienced immigration agents are expert at handling applications related to the new scale-up visa.

(135, 105, 'Europe Visa', '<h2>How to Apply for a Visa and Travel to Europe from India</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>Are you dreaming of Europe immigration, visiting its famous landmarks, or working in one of its diverse and dynamic countries? If so, you may be wondering what are the visa requirements and processes for Indian citizens who want to travel to Europe. In this post, we will give you an overview of the different types of visas you may need, depending on your purpose and duration of stay.<br />\r\n&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Types of visas for Europe</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Europe is not a single country, but a continent that consists of many countries, each with its own laws and regulations. However, some European countries have agreed to form a common area of free movement, known as the Schengen Area.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>A Schengen visa is a short-stay visa that allows you to visit any of the 26 countries that are part of the Schengen Area for up to 90 days within a 180-day period. The Schengen Area includes most of the European Union countries, except for Bulgaria, Croatia, Cyprus, Ireland, and Romania, as well as Iceland, Liechtenstein, Norway, and Switzerland. With a Schengen visa, you can travel freely within the Schengen Area without going through border checks at each country.<br />\r\n&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Applying for a Schengen Visa from India &ndash; Steps </strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Visiting Europe for tourism, business, family visits, or other short-term purposes requires a Schengen visa for Indian citizens. This is also known as a tourist visa for Europe from India. To apply for this visa, you need to contact the embassy or consulate of the country where you plan to spend most of your time in Europe, or where you will enter first if you plan to visit multiple countries. Alternatively, you can apply through a visa application center (VAC) authorized by the embassy or consulate.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>To apply for a Schengen Europe visa from India, you need to follow these steps:</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>Check the visa requirements and eligibility criteria for the country you want to visit. You can find this information on the official websites of the embassies or consulates or on this website.</li>\r\n	<li>Prepare the essential documents for your visa application. These may include your passport, application form, photos, flight reservation, hotel booking, travel insurance, proof of financial means, purpose of travel, and other supporting documents depending on your visa type.</li>\r\n	<li>Make an appointment online or by phone with the embassy or consulate or the VAC where you want to submit your application.</li>\r\n	<li>Go to your appointment and submit your application along with the Europe visa cost and biometric data (fingerprints and photo). The standard visa fee is &euro;80 (about Rs. 7,200) for adults and &euro;40 (about Rs. 3,600) for children between 6 and 12 years old. Some categories of applicants are exempt from paying the fee or pay a reduced fee.</li>\r\n	<li>Wait for your visa decision. The processing time for the Europe Visa may vary depending on the country and the season, but it usually takes around 15 days. In some instances, the time frame maybe 30 or 60 days. You can track the status of your application online or by contacting the embassy or consulate or the VAC.</li>\r\n	<li>Collect your passport with your visa sticker or have it delivered to you by courier. Check the validity and accuracy of your visa and make sure it matches your travel plans.<br />\r\n	&nbsp;</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Note:</strong> You can apply for a tourist visa to Germany from India if you want to visit Germany for a short stay (up to 90 days in a 180-day period). This visa is also known as a Schengen visa.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>What are Other Types of Visas for Europe?</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>If you want to visit a European country that is not part of the Schengen Area, such as the United Kingdom (UK), Ireland, Bulgaria, Croatia, Cyprus, or Romania, you will need a separate visa for that country. These visas are issued by each individual country according to their own rules and regulations. Some of the most common types of visas for Europe are:</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li><strong>National (D) Visa:</strong> This is a long-stay visa that allows you to stay in one specific country for more than 90 days. It may also allow you to travel within the Schengen Area for up to 90 days in a 180-day period. You need to apply for this visa at the embassy or consulate of the country where you want to stay.</li>\r\n	<li><strong>EU Blue Card:</strong> This is a Europe work permit that allows highly skilled workers from non-EU countries to live and work in any EU country except Denmark and Ireland. It is valid for up to four years and can be renewed. You need to have a valid job offer or contract from an employer in an EU country before applying for this card.</li>\r\n	<li><strong>Student Visa:</strong> This is a type of national (D) visa that allows you to study at an accredited educational institution in an EU country. It may also allow you to work part-time or full-time depending on the country and course. You need to have an acceptance letter from a school or university before applying for this visa.</li>\r\n	<li><strong>Family Reunion Visa:</strong> This is a type of national (D) visa that allows you to join your spouse, partner, parent, child, or other relative who is an EU citizen or resident in an EU country. You need to prove your family relationship and meet certain Europe visa requirements such as income, health insurance, and integration before applying for this visa.<br />\r\n	&nbsp;</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Note:</strong> If you are looking for a great country to relocate to, you might want to consider the Netherlands. You can apply for a Netherlands Schengen visa, which will allow you to enter and stay in the country.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>How to Apply for Other Types of Visas for Europe from India?</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Europe visa process for other types of visas for Europe from India is similar to the Schengen visa process, but with some differences. You need to:</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>Check the visa requirements and eligibility criteria for the country and visa type you want to apply for. You can find this information on the official websites of the embassies or consulates or on this website.</li>\r\n	<li>Gather the required documents for your visa application. These may include your passport, application form, photos, proof of purpose, proof of financial means, proof of accommodation, health insurance, language proficiency, and other supporting documents depending on your visa type.</li>\r\n	<li>Make an appointment online or by phone with the embassy or consulate where you want to submit your application.</li>\r\n	<li>Go to your appointment and submit your application along with the visa fee and biometric data (fingerprints and photo). The visa fee may vary depending on the country and visa type.</li>\r\n	<li>Wait for your visa decision.

Check the validity and accuracy of your visa and make sure it matches your travel plans.<br />\r\n	&nbsp;</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p>Whether you need a Europe tourist visa or a work visa, we are here to help you with your Europe visa process.

Lorem Ipsum has been the industry&#39;s standard dummy text ever since the 1500s, when an unknown printer took a galley of type and scrambled it to make a type specimen book. It has survived not only five centuries, but also the leap into electronic typesetting, remaining essentially unchanged. It was popularised in the 1960s with the release of Letraset sheets containing Lorem Ipsum passages, and more recently with desktop publishing software like Aldus PageMaker including versions of Lorem Ipsum.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\\r\\n\\r\\n</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Where does it come from?</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>\\r\\n\\r\\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Contrary to popular belief, Lorem Ipsum is not simply random text. It has roots in a piece of classical Latin literature from 45 BC, making it over 2000 years old. Richard McClintock, a Latin professor at Hampden-Sydney College in Virginia, looked up one of the more obscure Latin words, consectetur, from a Lorem Ipsum passage, and going through the cites of the word in classical literature, discovered the undoubtable source. Lorem Ipsum comes from sections 1.10.32 and 1.10.33 of &quot;de Finibus Bonorum et Malorum&quot; (The Extremes of Good and Evil) by Cicero, written in 45 BC. This book is a treatise on the theory of ethics, very popular during the Renaissance. The first line of Lorem Ipsum, &quot;Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet..&quot;, comes from a line in section 1.10.32.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\\r\\n\\r\\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The standard chunk of Lorem Ipsum used since the 1500s is reproduced below for those interested. Sections 1.10.32 and 1.10.33 from &quot;de Finibus Bonorum et Malorum&quot; by Cicero are also reproduced in their exact original form, accompanied by English versions from the 1914 translation by H.
